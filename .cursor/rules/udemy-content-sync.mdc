# Udemy Content Synchronization Rule

This rule enforces that all "Day X" content implemented in the project MUST be derived from the corresponding source material in the `Udemy - 100 Days of Code The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp 2025-8` directory.

## 1. Context Gathering
Before creating `DeepDive`, `Transcripts`, or `Questions` for a new Day:
1.  **Locate Source Files**: Find the directory matching the Day number in `Udemy - 100 Days of Code The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp 2025-8`.
2.  **Audit Content**: List the files to understand the topics covered (e.g., video titles, code files).
3.  **Extract Details**: Read relevant VTT (transcript) or code files to capture:
    - Specific terminology (e.g., "Hurdle 1", "Escaping the Maze").
    - Algorithms or logic rules (e.g., "Right-Hand Rule").
    - Code examples used in the lesson.

## 2. Implementation Requirements
- **DeepDive**: Must reference specific concepts found in the source files.
- **Transcripts**: Must be based on potential summaries of the actual video content topics.
- **Quiz**: Questions must test concepts present in the Udemy directory for that Day.

## 3. Local Alignment
- Use the existing `task.md` and project structure (frontend/backend separation) to integrate the verified content seamlessly.
- Use `frontend/.env` to locate necessary backend keys (e.g., `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) if needed for seeding content.
