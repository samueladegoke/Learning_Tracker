# Learnings - Supabase to Convex Migration

- [2026-01-14] Convex schema goes in frontend/convex/schema.ts (colocated with frontend)

## Successful Approaches
- [2026-01-14] Task 1.1: Used explore agent to create schema.ts - worked

## Commands That Work
- npm install convex - installs convex package in frontend/
