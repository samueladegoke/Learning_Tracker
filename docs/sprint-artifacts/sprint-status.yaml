# =============================================================================
# NOTES
# =============================================================================
# 
# Decision: 2025-12-13
# The original architecture.md described an ambitious Local-First PWA architecture.
# After review, we determined the current Server-First MVP meets all user needs
# and is successfully deployed to production.
#
# Phase 2 epics are preserved for future enhancement but are not blockers.
# The project_context.md and architecture.md have been updated to reflect this.
# =============================================================================
