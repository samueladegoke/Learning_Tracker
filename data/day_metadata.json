Now, if you head over to task number three, in today's set of exercises, you'll see the code that we had from previously. And today I want to talk about a different function. So we've seen the print function and all the things that we can do to strings and use the print function and debug it. But what if we wanted to be able to enter some data. So if we wanted to say ask the user what is your name? And we run this code, you can see that being printed, but there's no way for the user on this side to be able to give our code some data to work with. In order to do that, instead of using the print function, we're going to use a different function, and it's called the input function. And notice how as I'm typing code, intelligence is already giving me some suggestions because it thinks it knows what I might want and it's right. So this is what the input function looks like. This is the name of the function. And again it's followed by some parentheses. Inside the parentheses is the prompt that I'm going to give the user. So when I run this code it will say what is your name. Now this time you'll notice a couple of differences. Firstly it doesn't have that final line process finished with exit code zero. It's actually not saying anything at all. Plus, when you look up here, you'll see that in addition to the play button, there's the stop button being highlighted and the play button has changed this rerun symbol. So what does all of this mean? Well, it means that we're actually in the middle of the process of running our code. It hasn't exited yet. And what exactly is it waiting for? Well, it's waiting for us to click into this output pane and actually type in an input. So the prompt is the text that goes into the input command, and then afterwards we can add some actual input, whatever it is we want into the output area. And now once I hit enter, you'll see that finally we have the process finished with exit code. You'll see the stop button is gone and we can now rerun the code as usual. But where did this text go and how can we capture it? The input function looks pretty much identical to the print function, but instead of the word print, it's just got the word input and inside the parentheses. Instead of adding what text will be printed, we're adding the prompt for the user to give them a hint as to what kind of data we want. And then when you run this code, it will print out the prompt, but then there will be a cursor. In some places you'll see it like a flashing cursor, other places it'll just be a solid cursor. And in some places you won't even see a cursor until you click into the output area ready for the user to type in some piece of data. So what can we do with this data? Well, we can use it inside our code. Now the way that this works is when this line is run by the computer, it takes your command as understanding that you want the user. So somebody to be able to you want the user to be able to type in an input into this area and whatever it is they type, you're going to take it back into the code and replace this command with it. So this is a little bit abstract when we see it like this. But let's imagine we wanted to write a print statement and we wanted to say hello. And we wanted to greet the user. Now I know that in my case my name is Angela. So I would get it to say hello Angela. But what if you didn't know the name of your user. Well, you wouldn't just want to say hello user or hello something generic. You would want them to be able to type in their name. So this is where a little bit of string concatenation comes in, which we learned before. If we take this input function that we've explored just now, and we paste it into this print statement. So this can be a little bit confusing. So just concentrate right here. There's two parentheses at the end. And the reason for this is because this first one closes off the print statement. So we're saying everything between here and here. We want it to be printed. Now what is in between there. Well firstly it's the string that says hello and then a space and then what we had as the input. So whatever the user types into here will replace this highlighted part. And we'll end up with hello concatenate. So add to another string. So let's try this out. Let's go ahead and hit run and you can see the prompt show up in the output area. So now if I click into this area, my cursor starts flashing and I can type whatever it is I want. Now when I hit enter, what I type is going to go and replace this input function. And then once it's in there, the print function is going to carry out its role and it's going to add the word hello in front of it. And then print it out right here so we can see now hello Angela. But this is of course making our code a lot more adaptable. So if tomorrow I decided to change my name to a cherry. There's a really embarrassing story about this. So when I first moved to the UK, I wanted to pick my own name because I was nine years old and I wanted a very, uh, fruit related name. Um, and this was the name that I wanted. And my parents, as, as wise as they are, said, no, we will take your name. So that's how I ended up with the name Angela. So now you can see this gets added in to the hello and we can have a completely adaptable bit of code. So now it's time for a small challenge. Can you use what you've learnt from previous lessons and also this lesson to figure out how to add a exclamation mark to the end of the sentence that's being printed. So instead of just hello Angela, we want the output to say hello. And then we take in whatever it is the user inputs into here. And then we replace that with the user input. And finally we add an exclamation mark. Now of course we have to do this using strings and using what we've learned about Python code. So pause the video, read the description of the problem and see if you can solve it. Okay, so if you remember from string Catenation. What we need to do is we need to treat this input function as its own string, because eventually it's going to be replaced by a string. So we can take that part, set it aside, and then we can use the plus sign to concatenate the final character, which is a exclamation mark to this entire long string. So now if I go ahead and run this code and I type in an input, that input gets inserted and replaces this entire input function. And then finally I get the exclamation mark added to the end. If you find this line of code difficult to understand and to wrap your head around, then I recommend heading over to a website called thonny. Org and downloading an application called Thonny. It's completely free and it's available for windows, Mac and Linux. And once you've installed this application, you can go ahead and paste your line of code here and click on this little debug symbol. And then we can click on this button which is called the step into button, to step into the execution of this line of code to see how the computer is evaluating this code here step by step. So you'll see the first thing it tries to do is it will try to run this print statement. It looks inside these parentheses to see what it needs to print. So the first thing is this hello. And it turns that into a string. And then it looks at the next thing after the plus sign to see what it should turn this into. And this of course is the input function. So as I continue stepping into it it's actually going to execute it. So it's going to run this input function and show the prompt. What is your name. So that's what shows up down here. And now if I enter a value in here and hit enter, then that value that I put right there replaces that previous input function and is now held inside the print statement. So if I continue stepping through this code. Then you'll see it concatenates all of the pieces together. And finally it just ends up with a simple print. Hello, Angela! Exclamation mark. And if I continue stepping into it, you'll see that line of code executed until there are no more instructions left. So if you prefer seeing your code, um, run like this step by step so that you can see what's going on, then I recommend giving this a go. As you're learning to code, there's going to be new concepts covered. There's going to be things that take a little bit of thinking before you can understand it. So what a lot of programmers love to do is they like to comment in their code. Now, you might have seen this already throughout the coding exercises and the solutions I provided, but in Python, if you wanted a line of text to not be considered by the computer at all, all you have to do is add the hashtag or pound sign in front of your text, and this turns it into a comment. So something that the computer will completely ignore. So in here you can write code as much as you like, but it won't be executed. And when you click run, you'll see that this is completely ignored. What I recommend is whenever you come across a new concept in the course, to make a comment above it so that you can explain to yourself what's actually going on in the line of code below. This way, the next time you come across this line of code and you're not quite sure what's actually happening here, you can have a look at the notes that you've written for yourself in your own words, and hopefully it'll jog your memory and make it much easier to comprehend what's going on. In addition to adding a pound sign manually, you can also highlight a line of code or simply have your cursor on a line of code and hold down command and forward slash. If you're on Mac or Control and forward slash if you're on windows. And what this does is it takes this line of code out of the computer's awareness, and it's no longer executed when you run this code file. So the process is finished without anything being carried out at all, because all the computer is seeing is a blank page, because we've taken all the code out into comments. So in order to take this back into code, all you have to do is use the same command that you tried just now. So command forward slash on Mac or control forward slash on windows. And this will now again be considered as code by the computer. All right. So in this lesson we learned about the input function. We learned about putting functions inside other functions and being able to get user input from the console by using the input function. And if you've commented this line of code thoroughly and you've fully understood how it works, then you'll be able to breeze through the next exercise. So for all of that and more, I'll see you there. Now, in this lesson, I want to talk to you about Python variables, and it's a really, really useful concept. The first thing I want to do is to take a look at this line of code that you should have already, and when we run this, we should be pretty familiar with what happens, right? It will ask us for our name and when we hit Enter, nothing happens, but behind the scenes, this name or this input has now been received by this function. But once that's done, it kind of just disappears, right? And there's no way for us to be able to refer to it in the future. Or is there? Well, this is where variables come in really handy, if I give the result of this action, a name, well, then I'll be able to refer to it later on. So at the beginning of the line, I'm going to call it name, and then I'm going to add an equal sign, and what this does is it assigns whatever it is that the user typed in as the input to this prompt to a variable called name. So now if I go ahead and run my code again and I enter a name. Now, once I hit Enter, normally there's no way for me to get hold of this anymore, right? But now I can actually go ahead and write print, I'm going to print the value of this variable name. So now if I run my code and I write a name, hit Enter, you'll see that this gets printed. And I can use this at any point in my code just by referring to the name that's attached to this value. So it's almost like we've saved the data from this action to a name. And if you think about it, if you had a phone book, let's say, and you just jotted down the numbers of people, the next time you look at this, there's no way for you to know whose number that is, right? In a sense, it's the same thing with the computer, even though we've inputted this piece of data, there's no way for us to be able to refer to this data unless we give it a name. So in our phone book, we might say that this particular number is associated with the name James. And in programming, we would call this name, james, a variable. So we could write something like James =, and then his phone number. And this means that in the future, if we ever need this piece of data, we can just refer to it by its name, the variable name of james. Now, as the name variable suggests, it's something that can be changed or can be varied. So for example, just because this name is set to something up here doesn't mean that I can't change it later on. So to make things simple, let's go ahead and delete the input() function, and let's just say name is equal to jack. print(\"name\"). When I run that, jack is what gets printed inside the console, because I'm now referring to that piece of data by the variable name. But if later on I decide to give this variable a different piece of data to hold on to, let's say, Angela, and I print(name) at this time point after I've changed it, what do you think these two lines will print? What do you think will first be printed? What do you think will be printed second? So even though they're both printing the same variable at this point, when we first call print, it's holding on to the value of jack, but by Line 5, I've now changed it so that it's holding on to the value of Angela. So to practice that, I have a challenge for you. So I want you to be able to figure out how many characters are in the name that the user types in using the input() function. So you already know how the input function works, you already know how to get the user to enter it, and then to get that data back into our code and print it out, but here's the extra step, \"Can you calculate how many characters there are in the name that they type in?\" For example, if they typed in jack, that would be four. If they typed in Angela that would be six. Now how do we figure out things when we're programming and we're trying to do something that we haven't done before? Well, one of the most important skills as a programmer is to be able to use Google well. It's to be able to find the answers that you need because it's inevitable that you won't remember every single function and you won't know every single function. So we need to read documentation and we need to know how to get hold of it. So very simple, we start off with our query, \"how to find the length of a string.\" And then we add our programming language because this will be different in every programming language. So I normally just add Python to the end of it. And then once we hit Enter, normally we'll get hold of some form of documentation, and the W3Schools documentation for Python is not bad. And you can also browse through all of the other examples. So normally for Python, I stick to W3Schools or StackOverflow, and both of these will give you the right answer. But if we are reading documentation then you can see that normally there is a whole bunch of other things that we can look up, just like a dictionary of Python. Now, as you wouldn't start with a dictionary when you're learning a new language, believe me, I tried that, it did not work, you also wouldn't want to learn through everything in the documentation because it's very dry. And when you don't have a real-life application, when you're not trying to use a particular function or some sort of component, then you also don't remember it very well. So I recommend to find what you need when you need it, and our brain is for thinking and not for storing, because these days, as you know, it's super cheap to buy a single terabyte, storage hard disk online. I think it costs something like 10 or $20 and it's just getting cheaper every day. So don't use your brain to store things, use it to think. But coming back to our documentation here, in order to get the Python string length, we use the len() function. And just like the print() function, it's an inbuilt function in Python, so we can simply just write len(), and then we can use whatever it is we want to measure. For example, in this case it's, \"Hello world!\" and it will output the number of characters in that string. So now give it a go yourself. So the pause one is the instruction set. And I want you to get user input. I want you to take that user input and calculate the length of the string that the user inputted, and finally to print that number out into the output area. And everything could be done in just one line of code. So try to find the documentation, try to figure out how to do this, and I'll see you on the other side where we run through the solution. So pause the video now. All right. So referring to the documentation it's pretty straightforward. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to get hold of the input. So we know the input function looks like this, and we can add in whatever prompt we want. So what is your name? And then we're going to wrap this input inside another set of parentheses. And you can do that without having to type open and closing brackets, if you just highlight the entire line you want to wrap and then type the open bracket, and it should wrap everything inside. So the next step is to calculate the length which is using the len() function that we just heard about. And then finally I'm going to wrap everything in just one more bracket, and this one is the print() function. So the three steps are we get hold of the user input, we calculate the number of characters in that input, and then finally we print it out into the output area. So now let's go ahead and run our code. So first line that comes out is these two print statements from before. And then the third line asks me what is my name. And you can see the process is paused, waiting for me to type that in. And then once I hit Enter, that name is going to replace this part of our code and it's going to calculate the length. And then finally that length is going to be printed and we get 6, which is correct. That's the number of characters in my name. So hopefully you've learned a little bit about documentation and also search. And also the importance of being able to get your own answers as a programmer. So now I have another coding challenge for you. Can you use what you've learned about creating variables and using variables in order to take these two parts, the input() function, and the output of the len() function and store them in separate variables. So there should be a variable called username that will store whatever the user enters into the input area. And then using that variable you're going to create a variable called length to calculate the length of the username. So then instead of this combined print statement, we can end up with simply just printing length at the end. So that way we can get the same result as this, but we use several steps to get there by creating and using some variables. So give this a try. Pause the video and if it doesn't work, come back and we'll go through the solution together. Okay. So the first step is we're going to create our first variable which is called username. And this is simply going to be set to store whatever the user types into the input. And that will get stored under this reference username. And then we're going to use that to calculate the length of the username. But instead of putting the input into the length, we can now refer to it using our variable name, username. So now we can print this new variable that we created on Line 9 and through these three steps, we've made this one single line code hopefully a little bit easier to understand. So we get the username from the input, we calculate the length from the username, and then finally we print the length. And when we hit Run you'll see exactly the same thing happens. We get the same code. Now at this point, you might be wondering to yourself what exactly is the point of variables? We've just turned one very, very short line into three very long lines. Now, of course, we're working with very, very simple examples here. And it might be hard to see the exact use case, but as things get more complicated, you will be glad to know how to use variables. Even in this simple situation, you can see that instead of this line of code, having these three lines of code makes our code a lot more readable because we're labelling each step of our code, we're saying, well, from this line of code, we're going to get hold of the username, from this line of code, we're going to work out the length of the username. And then finally we're going to use that final variable and print it out. Now as things get more complex, and being able to split up code into smaller modules will become a lifesaver. So in the next lesson, I've got a coding exercise for you and hopefully through more and more examples, you'll see just how useful variables can be. Right now, bear with me and just try to learn to create variables and use variables, and I promise it's going to all become very, very clear very soon just how useful they are. Now, when it comes to naming your variables, you can pretty much call it whatever it is you want. So instead of calling this name, I could have just called it n, and I could have called this l, and as long as I'm consistent, so if I wanted to get the length of n, then I would have to change this as well. And if I wanted to print out l, then I have to change this as well. But there's a couple of rules that you should probably follow, and the most important one is to make your code readable. Because if you come back to this in 6 months, 12 months, n and l is not going to have a lot of meaning for you. So try to make sure that it actually makes sense to you. And if you want to, you can actually have multiple words in the name of your variable. So for example, if you wanted to call this username, then you would write the word user, and then you would separate each of the words with an underscore. But you can't have a space in between. This is not valid code. And if you try to run it, you'll get a SyntaxError. So the name of the variable has to be one single unit. And in order to separate words in Python we use the underscore. Now if you want to use numbers in the name of your variable you can. So for example length1, length2, but they can't be at the beginning of the name of the variables. So you can't say 1length, or 3length. That will generate a syntax error as well. Finally, there's certain privileged words that we use, for example, the names of our functions like print and input. And it's usually good practice to not use them as the names of your variables, because you can see that syntax highlighting gets messed up because it thinks that it's actually input() function you're trying to create. And even though often when you run your app it might not have any issues, this is really bad practice because it's very confusing. So try to make sure that all the names of your variables get highlighted like the other variables in the same color. Now, the final thing to remember is that if you decide to call your variable this particular name, N-A-M-E, and at a later point, you make a typo and you spell it wrong, so maybe instead of name, you said, nama, this is not going to work. And when you run your code, you'll get what's called a NameError because it says this name is not defined. And the idea is that you would look at where the error is, Line 2, print nama, and you'll see, \"Oh, that's not right.\" It's meant to be spelled, N-A-M-E, so you'll have to go and fix it in order for your code to work. Now remember that this is not because Python is doing any sort of spell checking for you. It's like, \"Oh, that's not how you spell name.\" No. In fact, if you decided to call this nama, and you later on use it as nama, there's no problems. Other than this green squiggly underline which tells you that there is a typo in this word, Python doesn't actually care, and that's why your file is still checked because very often you might be in the situation where you need to create something that is unique, right? You might have a player in your video game called Nama and you decide to call it that. It's totally up to you. And the only thing that Python really cares about is that you are consistent. This is the name that's associated with this piece of data, later on, when you want to use this piece of data, you use this name to refer to it. And as long as these two spellings are identical, then the computer doesn't care at all. So when you get a NameError in your code, you now know it's probably because you've misspelled or mistyped one of the variable names somewhere in your code. Now, in the next lesson, I've prepared a quiz for you where you'll get to select which variable names are valid, and which ones are not good practice. Have a go at that over on the next lesson. All right, guys, it's time for the final project of today. So the program that you're going to be building looks a little bit like this. And you can check it out if you head over to this link, either by typing it in or heading to the Course Resources page and clicking on the corresponding link. But essentially, it's a Band Name Generator, and it asks you for a city that you grew up in and the name of your pet, and then it combines those together and gives you the name of your band. There's a couple of things to note here. Firstly is notice when this input got triggered, the cursor actually showed up on a new line. So if I run this again, you can see it says, \"What's the name of the city you grew up in?\" And then the cursor is on the next line. And what I want you to do is to go ahead and head over to this stunning project. So there's a couple of steps in here as hints. But the important thing is, once you've completed this project, it should work exactly the same as the one that you see here. And in order to do this, you're going to have to apply everything that you learned today, including printing inputs, variables, new lines, string manipulation, debugging, and a whole lot more. So this is the time to grab yourself a cup of tea or coffee, pause the video, and tackle this final project. All right guys, I hope you gave that a go and you were able to complete it. If you want to see how I've implemented it, or if you want to, just check to see if you have any errors or if there's something that you're unsure about, then continue watching and I'll go through the solution with you. The first step is to create a greeting for your program. In our case, it says, Welcome to the Band Name Generator, so that's exactly what I'm going to create. And we print these messages using the print() function. So I'm going to say, \"Welcome to the Band Name Generator.\" And this when I run it will just print that message. Now the next step is to ask the user for the city that they grew up in. So in order to get some input from the user, we'll need of course the input() function. And we're going to ask them using the prompt which goes inside the parentheses, \"Which city did you grow up in?\" So now when I hit run it's going to ask me for the city that I grew up in and I'm able to add a reply like so. Now that data is just going to be lost to thin air unless I capture it and I give it a name. So I'm going to have to create a variable to hold on to the data that the user inputted. So we'll just call that city and then add the equal sign to assign whatever it is that the user typed in to this variable name. And now I have access to this city variable, and I can print it or use it later on if I want to, like so. Now the next step is to ask the user for the name of a pet. So we'll call that variable pet, and we'll assign it the value that the user inputs for what is the name of a pet? Now step four is to combine the name of the city and the pet and show them their band name. Now, there's quite a few ways of doing this, especially if you look around on the internet, but the way that you learned in today's lessons is using string concatenation. So we're going to do that. So we're going to use a print statement and tell them, \"Your band name could be:...\" And then we're going to add the name of the city, and then add a space and then add the name of their pet. So now when we run our code, it will ask us for the name of their city and then the name of a pet. And then it should combine those together and show us the name of our band. Now the final step is that the input cursor should show on a new line like this. So here's the cursor, but here's the input just so that you get a bit of space and you're not typing it in directly after the prompt here. Like what we have. So how do we do that? Well, you learned about modifying strings by creating a new line using the \\n, and we can add that both to the end of the city input and the pet input, and now when we run our code, you'll see that the cursor now shows up on the next line, and our program looks a lot better. So there you have it. This is how you solve this boss challenge. And this is how you create the Band Name Generator project. So I hope you had fun with me today, learning Python and a lot of the fundamentals of Python. And tomorrow I've got another jam-packed module of really awesome tutorials, and code challenges, and projects for you to sink your teeth into. I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow. So have a rest now and let your brain work on the things that you learned while you sleep, and I'll see you here bright and early. Good night, and see you tomorrow. Well done. You've just completed your first day. And remember that a journey of a thousand miles can't begin without the first step. So congratulations on doing that and completing it. Now, remember that the first few days might take a little bit longer than an hour to complete, just because I've got so much to teach you and so much to cram into each of these days. So it doesn't matter if you need to take a break in between, or if you need to take a nap in between even. Just come back to it whenever you can, and you don't have to do it strictly in the day by day order. Now, my hope is that you'll keep going and you'll come back tomorrow refreshed and you'll tackle the next day subjects with the same vigor that you did today. So, have a good rest and I'll see you tomorrow. Hi, this is where you start the course. But first I want to tell you a little bit about it, because this is more than a course. It's a journey. And it's a challenge. A challenge to yourself. I often hear people say, \"I want to learn to code\". \"I want to become an app developer\". \"I want a new job\". \"I want to build my app\", but without action, those words are meaningless. But *you* are different! I know it. Even though I don't know you personally, I know you purchased this course and you haven't left it at that. You've made a start. And success comes to those who show up. And you showed up today. I know you can do this. You can make your dreams come true. You can change your own future and you can change the lives of those people around you. One of the questions I hear most often is: \"What's the best way to learn to code?\". Well, here it is! It's the 100 days of code challenge. Code for at least an hour. \u23f3 Over 100 days. You're practising a muscle to get strong at coding. Then the next question inevitably is: \"Well, what do I do each day?\" And I've spent years thinking about this question. And finally, I'm now able to definitively answer that ... it's this course! Every day, you're going to learn and apply new programming concepts. After a hundred days of repeating this process, not only will you have covered the entire professional Python curriculum, you'll also be so good that they can't ignore you. There are just two rules to get the most out of this course. 1) Pledge to code for an hour a day for a 100 days. To keep yourself accountable. I recommend downloading the course pledge. This is a contract \ud83e\udd1d with yourself. You can print it out and pin \ud83d\udccc it somewhere. You can always see, for example, above your computer or on your desk. By signing the pledge, you're making a commitment to yourself. It's only for you. No one else needs to see it. You can download the pledge in the course resources for this lesson. The second rule is to log your progress. Using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag on Twitter. There are millions of other students who are on this journey with you. And they will support you when times get tough. I recommend tweeting your progress each day with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode and search the hashtag on Twitter to see what others are doing as a part of their 100 days. And that's all there is to it! So here's to your success and let's get started with the course. \ud83e\udd1e Hey guys, it's Angela here. After I made this course, I decided to take it myself so I could see what it's like to be in your shoes. Along the way, I realized there are things we could create, to make your learning experience easier and even more enjoyable. So in this video, I'm going to share my top tips. And how do you use all the tools \ud83d\udee0 and resources we built for you. The first tip I have for you is to use another screen. That way you can watch the lesson on a tablet or phone and code on your main computer. So you can code along with me and get practice instead of just listening to the videos. Programming is a practical skill. So, just as you need practice, when learning skateboarding \ud83d\udef9, you also need practice to get good at Programming. Tip number two: I created a Python syntax cheat sheet, which you can download and print out. It contains some of the most common programming concepts we'll learn. And it's a handy reference to have when you're doing the coding challenges. You can download this in the course resources for this lesson where you will also find my \"12 Rules to Learn to Code\" eBook. One of the hardest things about learning is keeping the \u2728motivation\u2728 high. I find I'm usually more motivated when I'm in the library or a cafe where I can see other people studying or working hard. So I decided to create a two-hour \"Study with Me\" a video where I'm concentrating hard. We'll work for 25 minutes at a time, and then take a five-minute break before we get back to the next Pomodoro \ud83c\udf45. Tip number four: when you're learning new programming concepts it's a good idea to note down how the code works while your mind is fresh on that topic. So I created a coding notes page that you can print out and collate to create a coding notebook. The notepaper is the perfect place to write down examples of coding concepts you've learnt. It comes with line numbers and handy indentation guides, which is super useful when it comes to writing out Python code. Coding is not like history. There's nothing you need to memorize. It's a bit like baking. You don't need to remember the recipe. You just need to get practice and understand how to use the recipe. One of the most helpful note-taking systems for learning is the Cornell note method. In our coding notebook we've incorporated all the key elements from Cornell, including the sidebar where you can write comments on each line of code and the bottom summary section, where you can write an overview of the concept you just learnt. In the course resources for this lesson you'll also find some desktop wallpapers I've created for you that contain some of the messages I keep around my desk to keep me motivated, and I hope they'll help you too. Tip number five:",

Even if you max out and \nspent a whole weekend at the gym, you will not see a visible difference in \nyour body. The more regularly you learn to code, the more likely it is that \nyou\u2019ll start seeing your ripped coding muscles.  (The irony is not lost on \nme). \nBut the problem is where do you find the time? Between working your \nfull-time job, spending time with your family and life admin, when are you \nsupposed to sit down and practice this \u201cdaily coding\u201d? \nWhile I was working as a doctor, I spent about 12 hours at the hospital, \n1-hour commuting and approximately 2 hours on general life-sustaining \nstuff, such as eating. So that left me with only 9 hours remaining in my day. \nTheoretically, 2 hours could be allocated to coding practice and 7 hours on \nsleep. But there is nothing more difficult than trying to convince your \nwork-saturated brain to sit down and learn when you could be watching \nGame of Thrones with a tub of ice-cream. \nBut then I found a trick. \nAs humans, we have a lot of inertia. This can be bad for us - I\u2019m looking at \nyou, \u201c24\u201d box set. However, we can also turn it to our advantage. I found \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n2 \n\nthat once I got started coding and making things, I got so absorbed into the \nproject, that I no longer cared about TV, food or sleep. There were quite a \nfew weekends when I coded until sunrise. \nSo how do we take advantage of this inertia? First, you must understand \nthat task-switching is very difficult. It requires a lot of motivation. If as soon \nas you get home, you slump on the sofa and switch on the TV, you\u2019ve \nalready lost that evening. This is because the amount of motivation required \nto task-switch and do something not driven by evolution like eating or \nsleeping is a Herculean task.  \nThis is why the moment you enter the door and change to a new \nenvironment is the most crucial moment. If at this moment, you tell yourself \nthat you are just going to do 20 minutes of coding practice, you will most \nlikely succeed and use your own inertia to end up learning for an hour or \nmore. No brain will perceive a 20-minute task as a lot of effort and you end \nup tricking your brain to take advantage of your evening.  \nThe next step is to develop a habit. Research suggests that in order to \ndevelop a new habit, you have to carry out the task daily for a month. I\u2019ve \nused this next trick for loads of different things, from exercising to coding, it \ninvariably works like a charm. To preface this trick, I want you to imagine a \nwall with five paintings hanging on it, four of which are perfectly aligned, \nperfectly horizontal, but one is crooked. Now really imagine it, is there a part \nof you that wants to fix it?  \nNow let\u2019s imagine a monthly calendar with boxes representing individual \ndays. If you nurtured that new habit on a particular day, then you make a \nline through that day. If you continued your streak the next day then you \nextend that line and so on and so forth. There is something about not \nbreaking a continuous line that motivates most people to continue to \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n3 \n\ndevelop a habit. As strange as it sounds, there are many times when I would \nhave given up, but compelled to continue because of a long, continuous line. \nTry it out with a printable calendar over \u200bhere\u200b. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n4 \n\n\u01f9\u00a0\nCode for a Purpose\u00a0\u00a0\n \nWhen I first started learning how to code, there were countless times when I \npicked it up then gave up, again and again. This is a common story amongst \nself-taught coders. Looking back, after teaching so many students, I finally \nrealise what\u2019s going on. A lot of beginners start learning to code by picking \nan arbitrary language and follow along with a bunch of tutorials. Copying \ncode, line by line, sometimes writing code to work out prime numbers, other \ntimes to find all the even numbers. But you know what? I can find prime \nnumbers a lot faster by Googling for it and picking out even numbers is \nreally not all that interesting. \nHere\u2019s the truth. If you are learning to code for the sake of learning to code, \nit\u2019ll be pretty difficult for you to get good at it. Skills that require a lot of \ntime to hone, like programming, will eat into your pool of internal \nmotivation. Something from within that makes you forget to eat and sleep. I \ncan honestly say that coding on my own projects is one of the most \nenjoyable things I do. It combines logical thinking with creativity, and at the \nend, you will have made something. In most cases, something that the \nworld has never seen. Something that could make your life easier or more \nenjoyable. Something that could make loads of people's lives easier and \nmore enjoyable. It\u2019s like making a crazy-beautiful custom motorbike in your \ngarage, without needing the garage or spending a cent on the components.  \nThis is what motivates most people. The creating part. The making part. So I \nurge you to start learning to code by following a tutorial that makes \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n5 \n\nsomething, anything. Of course, it\u2019s unlikely that at the beginning you\u2019ll be \nable to code up Clash of Clans or League of Legends. But you\u2019ll be able to \nmake something interesting. It could be a dice game or a flash-card app. But \nas long at the end of the tutorial, you\u2019ll have made something you can use \nand play with, then you\u2019ll be far more motivated to code to the end.  \nDuring all our courses, we always tell our students to think up of a simple \napp that they want to make. Something that uses the skills that they\u2019ve \nlearnt during the course but will also stretch them a little because they have \nto find out how to include some new functionality.  \nWe had a student who went on to make an app that wakes them up a \nminute earlier every day to ease the transition to an earlier waking time. \nThere\u2019s a student who made a custom slideshow app as a mother\u2019s day \npresent. Someone else made an app that is a timer for making perfect \nsteaks based on its weight and thickness.  \nThere are no limits on your imagination. It will be difficult when you start \nworking on your own app because there are no step-by-step instructions, \nbut it will also bring about the biggest improvement in your coding ability.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n6 \n\n\u01fa\u00a0\nThere is No \u201cPerfect\u00a0\nLanguage to Learn\u201d\u00a0\nWhenever I do large talks, there will always be one person who asks me \n\u201cwhich programming language should I start learning first\u201d? There is this \ncommon perception that somewhere out there lies a perfect language for \nbeginner programmers. Some argue it\u2019s Python, some say it\u2019s Swift.  \nBut I say they\u2019re all wrong.  \nA programming language is simply a tool. It is no different from any other \ntool in your hardware box. If you want to hammer a nail, you should be \nusing a hammer. If you want to fix your water pipes, you\u2019ll probably need a \nspanner. Yes, it\u2019s possible to hammer in a nail using the side of the spanner \nand the same programming language can be used to solve different types of \nproblems. The carpenter will tell you that his favourite tool is a hammer and \nthe plumber will say it\u2019s the spanner, but it still doesn\u2019t make it the \u201cbest \ntool to fix things\u201d.  \nA web developer will tell you that JavaScript is the best language to learn for \na beginner. A statistician will advise you that you\u2019ll be best served with the R \nprogramming language. But at the end of the day, all that matters is what \nyou are trying to do with your tool. If you want to make iOS apps, then learn \nSwift. If you want to make websites, you\u2019ll need JavaScript. But the good \nnews is the core programming concepts: loops, conditionals, functions, etc. \nthey\u2019re all the same. The difference is mostly syntactical. In English, we \nhave werewolves, in German they have Werw\u00f6lfe. It\u2019s still the same \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n7 \n\nshirt-ripping mammal that comes out during a full moon, it\u2019s just spelt \ndifferently.  \nPrinting to the console in Swift: \nprint(\u201cHello Werewolves\u201d)\u00a0\nPrinting to the console in Java: \nprintln(\u201cHello Werw\u00f6lfe\u201d)\u00a0\nSo, decide on the task that you are trying to accomplish, then pick the best \ntool for that task. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n8 \n\n\u01fb\u00a0\nUnderstand What You\u2019re\u00a0\nWriting\u00a0\n \nI have an issue with the way that most programming tutorials are written. \nThere are far too many tutorials where you see the \u201cthis is how you draw an \nowl\u201d phenomenon. \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n9 \n\nIt\u2019s almost as if the programmer had good intentions and started off by \nshowing you how to do everything, step-by-step. But then, at some point, \nhe realises that he has embarked on a Sisyphean task and gives up. I\u2019ve \nseen tutorials where the author starts off with an excruciating level of detail \nthen mid-way reverts to \u201cnow you simply set up a cloud database\u201d. Bearing \nin mind that this is a tutorial aimed at beginners! \nThis leads to a number of problems. The most common problem is a student \nwho just copies the code in the tutorial and has no clue what any of it does. \nWhy did he add that extra line after parsing the JSON? Why is he making \nthis dictionary differently from the last one? \nIt\u2019s very easy to get knees deep in one of these types of tutorials because it \npromises to teach you how to build \u201cFlappy Bird\u201d or \u201cCandy Crush\u201d. But \ntwo-thirds of the way in, none of the things you\u2019re typing makes sense and \nyou start seeing red all over the screen. Bugs. Loads of them. Why? No idea. \nNothing runs. The last 3 hours were spent copying code and you learnt \nnothing other than maybe that coding sucks.  \nDon\u2019t get into this trap. If you see a tutorial that has jumps from beginner to \nadvanced after line 3 or uses the word \u201csimply\u201d too liberally or doesn\u2019t \nexplain any of their code, then stop. Leave that tutorial.  \nThere\u2019s plenty of fish in the sea.  \nOther times, the author does try to explain what they\u2019re doing. But you still \ndon\u2019t understand a thing that they\u2019re saying, then you\u2019re in an advanced \ntutorial that won\u2019t improve your programming. It can be tempting to build \ngrand things, especially when the blog is promising that anyone can make it. \nBut if you can\u2019t work out what\u2019s going on, you\u2019re be better served by \nbuilding a better foundation.  \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n10 \n\n \nThe key to learning to code is all about ramping. You want to be stretched \nover and over again and for knowledge to be built on previous knowledge. If \nthat ramp is too steep, you\u2019ll get lost. If that ramp is too shallow, you\u2019ll get \nbored. The right gradient is different for everyone. That\u2019s why we encourage \nstudents to use the speed change functionality liberally on our tutorials. This \nway, you can listen at double speed if you\u2019re comfortable with the concepts \nand slow down to half speed if it\u2019s something unfamiliar and you need time \nto understand and absorb.  \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n11 \n\n\u01fc\u00a0\nIt\u2019s Ok to Not Know\u00a0\n \nSoftware engineers are purportedly the profession that has the largest \npopulation of Imposter Syndrome sufferers. Imposter Syndrome is a \npsychological phenomenon where people feel like frauds and massively \nunderestimate their own skills and abilities.  \n \nProgrammers tend to be self-critical and constantly feel that everyone else is \nbetter at programming than they. If you\u2019ve ever felt this way, you\u2019re not \nalone, as studies show that a massive\u200b \u200b70 percent of people have imposter \nsyndrome\u200b.  \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n12 \n\nI recently saw a post on the Q&A site Quora where somebody asked: \u200b\u201cWould \nI get fired at Google (or another big tech firm if I got caught using \nStackOverflow as a reference?\u201d  \nHe got a bunch of really great answers from engineers working at Google, \nAmazon and other major tech companies. Anybody who has worked as a \nsoftware engineer will tell you that \u200bnot\u200b looking at references is far more \nfrowned upon. In fact, I challenge you to find a single Google programmer \nwho has not used Stack Overflow. (If you\u2019re not familiar, StackOverflow is a \ncollaborative Q&A site for programmers). \nA lot of new programmers are afraid that by checking references and asking \npeople for help they will out themselves as a fraud who doesn\u2019t know to \nprogramme. Nobody can hold all the relevant information in their head. For \nexample, this is the name of an iOS method: \n \n- (id)initWithBitmapDataPlanes:(\u200bunsigned\u200b \u200bchar\u200b **)planes pixelsWide:(\u200bNSInteger\u200b)width \npixelsHigh:(\u200bNSInteger\u200b)height bitsPerSample:(\u200bNSInteger\u200b)bps \nsamplesPerPixel:(\u200bNSInteger\u200b)spp hasAlpha:(BOOL)alpha isPlanar:(BOOL)isPlanar \ncolorSpaceName:(\u200bNSString\u200b *)colorSpaceName \nbitmapFormat:(\u200bNSBitmapFormat\u200b)bitmapFormat bytesPerRow:(\u200bNSInteger\u200b)rowBytes \nbitsPerPixel:(\u200bNSInteger\u200b)pixelBits; \n \nIt\u2019s almost 400 characters! \nIn iOS programming, there are over 800 classes, 9000 methods and \ngrowing. In web development, there\u2019s a new framework every week. No one \nwill expect you to be able to remember the code. This is the precise reason \nwhy we are programmers, we can get the computer to do the boring stuff \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n13 \n\nfor us. For example, the code for recording sound is only a short search \naway, why would you need to memorise it? \nThe skill that most employers look for when recruiting is the ability to think. \nKnowledge is valued in a world where information is hard to come by. In the \n1800s, only the rich had access to good books and good teachers. Now, \neveryone has all the information they had and more at the tap of a mouse. \nInformation is losing value, the ability to think is the stock to buy. So don\u2019t \nbe afraid to search, to ask on StackOverflow or to find resources to help you \nsolve your issues. The best programmers do it.  \nThe skill you need to hone is in asking good questions and understanding the \nanswer. There is no point copy-pasting code from a StackOverflow answer if \nyou have no clue how it works. Because StackOverflow works on a \nreputation system, it\u2019s in their interest to be as clear as possible in their \nanswer in order to be marked as correct and collect upvotes. \nIn most cases, it doesn\u2019t make sense to start searching StackOverflow \nwhenever you get stuck. The first option should always be trying to figure it \nout yourself. So your program doesn\u2019t do what you expected it to, but before \nI typed the last 3 lines of code, it was working fine. So let\u2019s figure out what \nin those last 3 lines broke my app? \nIf you really can\u2019t figure it out, start with Google. Search for your query or if \nyou have a bug paste the error codes and the error message. Chances are \nthat as a beginner, your programming woes will be very common and \nsomebody might have even taken the time to write a clear and concise \ntutorial to help you understand your bug. As you grow more skilled in \nprogramming, the problems you\u2019ll encounter get more and more obscure, \nbut hopefully, if you followed the other 11 rules, you will also be a more \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n14 \n\ncapable programmer and figure it out yourself or know exactly where to get \nhelp.  \nThe other reason why you should start with Google is that StackOverflow\u2019s \nsearch algorithm organises questions and answers by recency and not \npopularity. A lot of the problems you will encounter while starting out will \nhave been asked and answered years ago but still massively popular.  \nSo ask wisely and you will reap the benefits from the community. One day \nwhen you yourself become a code master, you\u2019ll be giving back to that same \ncommunity and helping the next generation of programmers.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n15 \n\n\u01fd\u00a0\nBe a Copycat\u00a0\n \nAt the beginning of my coding journey, I thought the way to learn to code \nwas to read a whole bunch of books. I bought books on C++, C#, Java and \nloads more. You name it, I had it. But they didn\u2019t do very much other than \nmaking me confused.  \nI read. I highlighted. I forgot. I fell asleep. \nBooks are good as references. If you want to dive deep into delegates and \nprotocols, read the chapter on that. But if you want to learn, \u200bmake \nsomething\u200b\u200b.  \nBut what do you make?  \nLacking in ideas? Be a copycat. Make your own notepad, make your own \nMSPaint, make your own piano. If you\u2019re into games, make minesweeper, \nmake Tetris, make Flappy Bird. Not only will they be sort-of useful, but \nthey\u2019ll also be the perfect opportunity for you to figure out how to do things \nand get experience in finding help. Something that is brand new to the world \nlike holographic smartphone projections, no one will be able to help you \nwith. By making copycat apps or programs, you\u2019ll be treading in the path \nthat many have walked before you. This way you maximise the chances that \nsomeone will be able to offer you help and advice when you get stuck. \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n16 \n\n\u01fe\u00a0\nBe Accountable\u00a0\n \nBe accountable to someone. Show your work.  \nThe biggest problem with online coding courses is the lack of accountability. \nNo doubt there are loads of great Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), \nsuch as Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Skillshare. But what are the \nconsequences of not doing your homework or missing a month\u2019s worth of \nlectures? Nothing. Nobody cares.  \nLet\u2019s face it, internal motivation is not strong in any of us. We can always \nfind a reason why we \u200bdeserve\u200b to \u201cNetflix and chill\u201d. I can\u2019t even count how \nmany online courses I\u2019ve signed up to and subsequently not listened to a \nsingle lecture or completed a single piece of coursework.  \nYou need accountability and commitment to learning. Think back to your \nuniversity days, would have bothered to finish that essay at 3 AM if nothing \ndepended on it? Would you have gone to any of the lectures if you didn\u2019t \ncare about passing or failing? \nThis is why we try to introduce accountability into our courses. We\u2019ve \nrealised that matching up students with a buddy helps. Someone else who is \na beginner, at the same level as you who sometimes helps you and other \ntimes needs your help. Sometimes, as people\u2019s learning rates diverge or if \nyou\u2019re paired up with a lazy bugger, you can swap it up and get a new \nbuddy. Because this system is entirely voluntary, there a degree of \nself-selection for people who work well in teams and are motivated by \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n17 \n\nothers. Just as you\u2019re more likely to go to the gym if you sign up with your \npartner, you\u2019re more likely to learn if you have a coding buddy. \nSo if you\u2019re not on our course then find your own. There\u2019s plenty of \nFacebook groups dedicated to those who are learning to code. There\u2019s an \nentire subreddit (r/learnprogramming) dedicated to this, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find \nlike-minded people somewhere online or offline. \nThe next thing I\u2019m going to tell you will be controversial. We believe that \npeople don\u2019t value things that don\u2019t have a value. This is the reason why \nCoursera is taking down a large number of their free courses. They saw that \nmillions of people were signing up for it but no one was taking any of the \nclasses let alone complete any of the projects. It was actually detrimental to \nstudents\u2019 learning to offer a free course. We all have a degree of hoarding \ntendencies and it\u2019s very easy to signup for a bunch of stuff that the \nfuture-you can suffer through. There\u2019s always tomorrow, she says.  \nSo if you are driven more by external motivation than internal, try to use a \nlittle bit of financial motivation to drive your learning. Think about how much \na life skill is worth to you and put your money where your intentions are. \nSee if you\u2019re engaging with the course content more with or without the \nfinancial commitment. There are plenty of places where you can pay \nsomething affordable to motivate yourself to start a regular learning habit.  \nThe final part of this rule is to try and find ways of getting assessed. Ok, so \ngetting assessed is right up there with death and taxes in terms of how \nmuch people enjoy it. But when learning anything, it\u2019s always important to \nget feedback. You will get an objective assessment of your current skill level, \ninstead of feeling like an imposter or brimming with false confidence. \nCoursera has a system where the students mark each other's\u2019 work. At the \nApp Brewery, we use Github education to test your code and look for bugs \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n18 \n\nand problems with your code. But if you\u2019re on a coding course that doesn't \nhave a system like this, then it\u2019ll be worth your while to find a code mentor \nwho can review your code and give you feedback. Only what\u2019s measured can \nbe improved. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n19 \n\n\u01ff\u00a0\nKeep Learning\u00a0\n \nBeing a good programmer is a bit like being Madonna.  \nDon\u2019t run out and buy your cone-shaped bras just yet. What I mean is \nprogramming will keep evolving. In order to stay relevant, you have to keep \nre-inventing yourself.  \nThere\u2019s always new trends, new technologies and new languages. Great \nprogrammers relish in learning new things, even if it means they become a \nbeginner again.  \nThe world will keep moving, if you stay in one place, you\u2019ll eventually be left \nbehind. I know programmers who never learnt anything else apart from \nFortran. I know Objective-C programmers who can\u2019t persuade themselves to \nmake the leap and learn Swift, even though Apple is telling developers that \nObjective-C will be phased out. We all know that Apple never makes threats \nthat they don\u2019t carry out, just look at the optical drive (and soon the \nheadphone jack?). \nDon\u2019t be the optical drive. Or rather, don\u2019t be the laptop that\u2019s still trying to \nplay CDs. If your needs change, learn to use a new tool. Keep learning, stay \nrelevant.  \nAre you a web developer who always wanted to get into mobile \ndevelopment? Pick a platform and learn iOS or Android. Are you a front-end \ndeveloper who is tempted by the full-stack? Pick up web development with \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n20 \n\nNode. If you already understand the core programming concepts, picking up \na few more languages will be a lot easier than starting from scratch.  \n\u201cLearn x in y minutes\u201d is a great resource for existing programmers to learn \nnew programming languages. Check out their resources here: \nlearnxinyminutes.com \n \n \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n21 \n\n\u0200\u00a0\nPlay Foosball\u00a0\n \nWhen you see Hollywood movies about programmers, they\u2019re usually sat in \nfront of a laptop, mashing the keyboard like they\u2019re in some sort of \nhigh-stakes \u201csmash the mole\u201d game.  \nWhen you see \u200breal\u200b\u200b programmers working. They tend to look like this: \n \nYep, that\u2019s right. No typing. Just staring. A lot of staring.  \nIn a company, people tend to complain that the programmers are always \nplaying foosball or doing something else that doesn\u2019t look like work. People \nmight not be able to tell, but they are in fact working.  \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n22 \n\nWhen you see them enjoying their foosball game, laughing and joking, \nthey\u2019re probably suffering inside. For there\u2019s a bug, there\u2019s always a bug. Or \nthere\u2019s something mysterious about their code that they can\u2019t work out. \nMaybe the code is working perfectly, but unexpectedly (programmers don\u2019t \nlike anything unexpected by the way). Like if they just typed out a thousand \nlines in one go\uff0cand \u200bunexpectedly\u200b there are no errors.  \n \nOther people might not understand, but in these situations, it\u2019s almost \nalways worth stepping away from your code and giving it some time and \ndistance.  \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n23 \n\nDo you have a bug in your code that you can\u2019t work out? Sleep on it, play \nfoosball, go for a walk. In 9 out of 10 cases, the solution will become \napparent. In the remaining 1 out of 10 cases, you\u2019re just screwed.  \nThis may sound unintuitive, but my advice is always to code less, think \nmore. Once the poorly thought-out code is written and brought into the \nworld, you\u2019ll inevitably have to go back and comb through your code, \nline-by-line, refactoring and deleting things. This is always a painful \nexperience.  \nSo remember, the easiest code to get rid of is the code that was never \nwritten.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n24 \n\n\u01f8\u01f7\u00a0\nGet a Mentor\u00a0\n \nWhen I was learning French, I came across a method that resulted in the \ngreatest leap in my speaking abilities. That was having language exchanges \nover Skype. I would pair up with a native French speaker who wanted to \nlearn English. We would spend half an hour speaking French and half an \nhour speaking English. We would both dedicate an hour each week to \nimproving the language that we were trying to learn.  \nWhile we were having a conversation in French, he would correct my \npronunciation or grammar and suggest the ways that I could construct my \nsentences to sound more native.  \nPair programming is an agile software development technique that\u2019s based \non very similar principles. For example, a learner and a mentor would sit \ndown at the same workstation and work on a problem. The learner is in \ncharge of writing code and the mentor reviews the code line-by-line as they \nare written.  \nIt can be uncomfortable at first because it\u2019s a bit embarrassing making \nmistakes and having them pointed out to you. But if you have a mentor who \nis a good teacher then they will offer you decades of accumulated wisdom \nthat can lead to massive improvements in your own ability, all within a few \nhours.  \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n25 \n\nYou\u2019ll get to tap into someone who\u2019s had the time to hone their skills, find \nefficient ways of doing things and show you how they program and approach \nproblems.  \nGood mentors don\u2019t solve your problems, rather they practice the Socratic \nmethod of asking good questions that get you to think for yourself. If you \nask me how to write a networking call, of course, I can simply type it all out \nand get you to copy it. But that doesn\u2019t help you. Instead, if you show me \nhow you approach the problem and I show you how I approach the problem \nthen you can learn so much more than just following a recipe.  \nThe next time you encounter a different problem, you can apply the same \napproach and start solving it yourself. Always remember that information is \ncheap. A century ago, if I wanted to learn about the causes of disease, I \nprobably had to be an aristocrat, or chop wood and carry water for a master \nand become their apprentice. Nowadays I can search Google and get my \nanswer in a few seconds.  \nSo don\u2019t get hung up on information. Learn to think instead. How to \napproach a problem. How to break down the problem. How to frame the \nproblem. These skills will take you much further than simple memorisation \nand regurgitation.  \nBut where do you find a mentor?  \nThere are programming related Meetups happening in almost every city in \nthe world. Go to \u200bwww.meetup.com\u200b and find one related to a language you\u2019re \ntrying to learn. Attend the meetups, get to know people. Exchange your \nexpertise for their expertise. Maybe someone needs an accountant, maybe \nsomeone needs legal advice. Exchange your time for their time. Don\u2019t say to \nsomeone, \u201cwill you be my mentor?\u201d. No one wants to throw away their free \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n26 \n\ntime for some stranger. Instead, offer your help in return for their help and \nyou\u2019ll be successful in finding a mentor 95% of the time.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n27 \n\n\u01f8\u01f8\u00a0\nGet into the Habit of\u00a0\nChunking\u00a0\n \nSo you have an awesome app idea. But it\u2019s way-way-way too complicated \nfor your current skill level. What do you do? You join the Chunking Express. \nNope, I\u2019m not talking about the art house movie. I\u2019m talking about breaking \ndown your programming problem.  \nLet\u2019s say that you\u2019re trying to make a robot that can butter toast. (If anyone \nis working on one of these I\u2019d happily fund your Kickstarter!) The robot \ndoesn't know anything about toast or butter or knives. Believe it or not, it \nactually takes pretty sophisticated circuitry in our brains to be able to \nachieve something as simple as buttering a slice of toast. (This is probably \nwhy I can\u2019t seem to do it without coffee). \nSo creating a robot that does all of that autonomously is really complicated \nand difficult. But as we\u2019re good programmers, we can do some chunking and \nbreak down the problem. \nThe robot doesn\u2019t really need to know what is toast and what is butter, we\u2019re \nnot making Skynet here, so let\u2019s just stick to the practical things. There are \nthree things we need the robot to do: \n1.Pick up and arrange the piece of toast in the ideal buttering position. \n2.Pick up a serving of butter. \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n28 \n\n3.Place butter on toast with decent coverage (this is the part I find most \ndifficult). \nNext, you break each module down even further. In the process, you can \nthink about alternate ways of solving the problem. For example, does the \nrobot need to \u201cspread\u201d the butter? Or can it just melt the butter onto the \ntoast? Does it need to learn to pick up a knife? Or can it have some sort of \ninbuilt knife-arm, like some sort of prison shiv pirate? \nThe more that you break down problems and define the issue that you\u2019re \ntrying to solve, the easier it is to package your code into bite-sized chunks. \nThe simpler the chunk, the easier it is to tackle.  \nSo the next time that you\u2019re trying to make that \u201ccross between Snapchat \nand Evernote\u201d, remember to break down the problem into solvable chunks.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n29 \n\n\u01f8\u01f9\u00a0\nBreak someone else's\u00a0\ncode\u00a0\n \nOne of the most important steps to take in order to make the jump from \nlearner coder to a fully fledged programmer is understanding how to get \nhelp. Everyone needs help. Everyone, including those so-called \u201cGod Level \nProgrammers\u201d. \n \nBut what you do with the help will determine how fast you progress as a \ncoder. On a site like StackOverflow, it can be very tempting to just copy and \npaste the code that someone has provided. Your program works exactly as \nyou hoped it would and off you go on your merry programming ways. This \nexercise didn\u2019t teach you anything other than code reliance. Because the \nnext time you encounter the same problem but in a different situation, that \nsame code snippet that someone provided may not work anymore. Then \nwhat do you do? You\u2019re stuck. \n \nThat\u2019s why there\u2019s a rule in programming that says \u201cnever copypaste code \nthat you don\u2019t understand\u201d. So what should you do when you\u2019re confronted \nwith a block of code that solves your problem but you have no clue how it \nworks? Break it down. \n \nStep 1 - Copy and paste the code into your program. (yes, yes, I know I just \nsaid not to do that, patience, patience). \n \nStep 2 - Make sure that your program or application is functioning as \nexpected. I.e. confirm that block of code really did solve your problem. \n \nStep 3 - Delete the copy and pasted block of code line by line. \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n30 \n\nStep 4 - Each time you delete a line, check to see what\u2019s been broken. Does \nthe app still run? What are the error codes? What has deleting that line of \ncode done to your program? \n \nStep 5 - Even if you think you know what a line of code does, delete it \nanyway. The most important task as a programmer is to always test your \nassumptions against the outcome. For the most enjoyable feeling as a \nprogrammer is for the real world to validate your assumptions. You know \nhow nice it is when your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife says those \nmagical three words?  \n \n\u201cYou were right\u201d. \n \nIt\u2019s like that, but better. \n \nStep 6 - Swap some of the lines around. Can the same functionality be \nachieved with a different order of lines? Why were they written in the order \nthey were written in? \n \nBy breaking the solution code, line-by-line, you\u2019ll learn and understand what \neach line does and why it\u2019s been written. This is a far better way to use code \nfrom other people than just pasting it in and hoping for the best. Once you \nunderstand why each of those lines was necessary, the next time you \nencounter a similar problem, you\u2019ll be able to tease out the problem and \nsolve it yourself.  \n \nOnce you\u2019ve mastered breaking code from StackOverflow, the next resource \nto target is GitHub. It\u2019s a tool used by programmers for collaboration but it is \nalso one of the largest repositories of open source code.  \n \nSo how can you use it to become a better programmer? Let\u2019s say that you \nwant to make an Instagram clone. But unfortunately, you don\u2019t know how to \ndo that. So you head over to github.com and search \u201cInstagram\u201d or \u201cphoto \napp\u201d.  \n \nInevitably, there will be something written in Swift/Objective-C/Java that \nyou can download and take a look at.  \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n31 \n\nThink about the structure of their program. Take a look at all the classes, \nthe constants, the interplay. Make some modifications to the code. Does it \nstill work or have you broken it? Why did you break it? Is there a link that \nyou didn\u2019t identify? Ask yourself a bunch of questions, learn through the \nSocratic method. Tear down the project and understand how it was built.  \n \nWhen you start getting really good at this, the next thing you can try is \nreverse engineering. Find a small project on GitHub made by a reputable \nprogrammer, download the app. Run it and see all of its functionality. Play \naround with it.  \n \nThen build it from scratch and once you\u2019re done, compare your code to their \ncode. Are there efficiency gains that you could have made? Are there \nsolutions to things you couldn\u2019t figure out? Now you\u2019re really getting into the \nbig leagues.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll rights reserved \u00a9 The App Brewery \nwww.appbrewery.co \n32 \n\n \nThat\u2019s all for now folks.

It's a completely free piece of software and is used by professional Python developers across the globe. They also have a handy course template feature, which we'll be using for the beginner parts of the lessons from Day 1 to 15. So while you might have another favourite code editor, I only recommend to use PyCharm for this course. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p><p>Download and install Python to your computer. Head over to the official Python website to download the latest version of Python for your computer system. Then complete the installation.</p><p>Make sure you tick the box to <strong>Add to PATH</strong> / <strong>Add to Environment Variables</strong>. You will also need <strong>tcl/tk</strong> later in the course, so a Custom install gives you access to all of these settings.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p><p>Download the Free Community Edition of PyCharm using the link below:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/edu-products/download/#section=pycharm-edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.jetbrains.com/edu-products/download/#section=pycharm-edu</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>IMPORTANT: If you already have PyCharm, make sure you update to the latest version of PyCharm otherwise the steps below might not work!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p><p>Once PyCharm installs successfully, you should see the welcome screen.

      "if you feel like you can tackle this, no problems, then feel free to skip today's lessons, but I bet that there'll be loads of stuff that you'll come across in the upcoming lessons and coding exercises that's really going to make you a better developer. So once you're ready to get started, head over to the next lesson and let's start coding. Hey, you've completed day 2, so you haven't just done one lesson, you've actually done two now in a row, which is fantastic. And in fact, you are now above 50% of all the people who start something and never finish. But I know you, I know you're not one of those people. I know you're going to keep going and you're going to get this in the bag. So keep going, have a rest, have a good night's sleep. And I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning. Yesterday, you saw that we could use the len() function to get the number of characters in a string. So for example, when I write len(\"hello\"), and I print this out, we end up with 5, there is 5 characters in the string \"hello\". Now here's a question. What happens if instead of counting the number of characters in a string, what if I put in a number instead and I wanted to know how many digits are in this number? Now, if I go ahead and run this code, you'll see that it actually crashes. I get a whole bunch of red text, and it tells me that there is a TypeError and something about the type 'int'. So what is all of this about? Well, in order to understand it, we first have to learn about Data Types. Now, on day one we already explored this data type called strings. Now, you're probably not going to be surprised to learn that there's a whole lot more other data types out there. And today we're going to explore some of the most important and some of the most basic data types, such as Strings, Integers, Floats, and Booleans. And we'll explore each of these in detail. So let's take a look at some of the data types. So we already learned about strings, right? And we know that this is just a string of characters. So the word \"hello\" is comprised of these five characters strung together. And we always know that strings, when we create them, we have to create them with these double quotes around. Now, because this is a string of characters we can actually pull out each character individually. So we could, for example, instead of just writing \"hello\", we can add some square brackets. So take a look on your keyboard and see where those are. And inside the square brackets we can put the index or the position of the character that we want. So for example, if I wanted to have the first character out of this word, \"Hello\", I would put 0 right here. And if I go ahead and print what this actually will give me, you'll see that you get capital H, because that is the first character of this string. And it's really important to remember that programmers always start counting from zero because we work with binary zeros and ones. So whenever you want to get hold of the first character or the first of anything, it always is at 0. So this method of pulling out a particular element from a string is called subscripting, and the number in between the square brackets determines which character you're going to pull out. And it just goes up from 0 to 1 to 2, and so on and so forth. So whenever you get a result that's just off by one, then remember to check whether if you've started counting from zero or if you started counting from one. Now you can of course extend this and get hold of the last character. So pause the video and see if you can change the code so that O gets printed out here. All right. So this is as simple as simply counting from zero, one two, three, four. So if we change this to 4 and we run our code, then you'll see that O gets printed instead of the H. Now there's also a secret trick that not many people know, even seasoned Python developers, and it's the fact that you can actually use negative indices. So instead of specifying the position as a positive number, you can also use a negative number, and -1, means get hold of the last character in the string so we can go ahead and run this, and you can see it's also O, and we can start counting backwards as well, starting from the end going to the beginning. So that's just a quick tip. So by using these square brackets and putting a number inside, we're able to dissect our string and pull out individual characters as and when we need it, and this will come in really handy in a lot of the programs that you'll write in the future. Now, it's important to remember, though, that just because I can write a number like, \"1, 2, 3,\" as long as it's capped inside these double quotes, then this is not treated as a number by the computer. It's treated just as any other piece of text. You can't, for example, say, what is \"123\" + \"345\"? If I try to print this, what do you think will happen? Do you think it will give me 123+345, in the traditional sense, like calculating it? Or do you think it'll do something else? All right, let's hit Run. And we get 123345. So it's basically just concatenated these two strings together, just as we have done with other strings like Hello and World. Right? Because it sees the data type of these two pieces of data as strings, when we use the plus sign, it will actually just concatenate these two things instead of doing a mathematical operation. Now, if we wanted to do that, then we actually have to declare our number as a number data type. So one of the most common that you'll see is called an integer. So this is programming lingo for just whole numbers. Numbers without any decimal places. And in order to create an integer or declare an integer data type, all you have to do is just write the number without anything else. So now if I just write the numbers 123 + 345, and then I go ahead and print this, then you'll see that we actually get 468. So it's actually being calculated because I've got actual numbers instead of strings. Just as we have some useful things that we can do with strings, there's some really handy things that you can do with integers. Commonly, when we write large numbers, at least in the UK or in the US, we like to put commas in between the thousands. So when we think of large numbers with these commas in between to split it into an easier to understand number, in Python we can replace those commas simply with underscores, and it will be interpreted by the computer as if you had written this. So the computer actually removes those underscores and ignores it. The benefit is just for us humans to be able to visualize it more easily. So I mentioned that all whole numbers, no matter if they're positive or negative, are called integers in programming. So what do you call it when you actually have decimal places? Well, they're called a float. And this is short for a floating point number. So for example, if you had the numbers of pi, you have 3.14159. And this because it has a decimal place is now a float data type. So if you think of the decimal point as being able to float around the number because it could occur at any point, then you've got yourself a floating point number. Now the final data type is something called a Boolean. And this is very simple. It only has two possible values True or False. Now note how these values always begin with a capital T or a capital F, and they don't have any quotation marks around them or anything. So this is actually a data type which is going to be used a lot in your programs to test if something is true or if something is false, and for your program to respond accordingly. So we're going to be using this a lot more in the future. Now that you've seen a lot of the basic data types Strings, Integers, Floats, and Boolean, I want you to head over to the next lesson where I've got a quiz for you to see if you've made this knowledge your own. So head over to the quiz and give it a go. Previously, we saw how the len() function gives us a TypeError when we give it a number instead of a string. So let's talk a little bit more about data types and functions. And the way I think about functions is kind of like some sort of fancy machine that you might see in a factory. Right? So in this case, we've got some sort of machine that's going to take potatoes into chips, and we don't really care how it does it, but it's probably going to have to peel the potatoes, wash the potatoes, cut it up, fry it, and then finally return it to us as an output in the form of fries. And if this is the first time that you're watching one of my tutorials, this is probably a health warning, I talk about food a lot. So be prepared if you haven't eaten. Now, let's say that we took the same machine that normally processes potatoes, and we decide to give it a rock, and we just pass this through the function, then we're going to get an error. Right? This is basically what happened here. This len() function doesn't like working with integers, and by forcing this through we end up with an error and our code breaks and it gives us this thing, a TypeError. Now if we hover over this yellow warning we also get the explanation here. Expected type...something called, 'Sized', and got 'int' or an integer instead. So this is already pretty clear where our mistake is even before we hit Run. And the other helpful thing is, when you hover over any function in PyCharm, it gives you the definition of it, and in between the brackets, you can see the data type that that function expects. So the len() function expects a data type with something that's called, Sized. And we can actually click on this link to see the documentation on docs.python.org, which is the official Python documentation. Now I know previously I told you to try using something like W3Schools or using StackOverflow, and the reason is because the documentation from the official Python organization is very, very short. So sometimes it can be enough, but very often I find that it's helpful to find another source to back up this very, very brief explanation. But in our case, in this situation, it does help us. For example, it tells us that len() will return the length, which is the number of items of an object, and the argument, which is what you put in between the brackets may be a sequence such as a string, byte, tuple, list or range, or a collection such as a dictionary set or frozen set. Don't worry about these other data types that we haven't come across yet. We're going to come across them in due time and we're going to be learning all about them. But for now, you already see one that you recognize which is string. So it can take string, but nowhere in this list does it say it can take an integer or any other number data type. So as the first pause exercise, I want you to fix this len() function so that we actually give it data type that it recognizes. And we fix this TypeError so that when we run it, it works as expected. And you can put anything in there as long as it gets rid of the warnings and errors. Pause the video now. All right. This should be relatively easy. We can change this to any string, which we already know is a data type that this function can accept. So we can simply change it to \"Hello\" or whichever string you can think of. And now when we hit run, all our errors and warnings should now go away. If you see something like \"PEP 8 blank line at end of file,\" and it bothers you, don't worry about it too much, but it's basically saying that in an ideal situation, a Python file should only have one blank line at the very bottom. So if I hit Run again, that will clear up that warning. For everybody out there who has a little bit of OCD like me, this can be a lifesaver. So now that we've seen that in Python, each function expects to work with a specific set of data types, so there's only certain data types that can go into the parentheses of a particular function. Now here comes the question, \"Well, how would we know what data type a particular piece of data has?\" So how would we know what is the data type of \"Hello\"? Well it's very easy to visually see it because it has the double quotes around it, and anything with double quotes around it, even if it's a number, is in fact a string. But there is also one function in Python that allows us to check the data type of any piece of data or variable. So all we need to do is to use the keyword \"type\", and then in between the parentheses we can put in any piece of data. It can accept any data type. And then it will give us in return the data type. But as always in order to see it we have to wrap this inside a set of parentheses and use the print statement to put this into the output area. So let's run that. And you can see it tells us that this is something called a class 'str'. So this is basically saying it checked the data type of this piece of data we gave it, and it told us that it's actually a string which is what we expected as well. So we can do this with various different data types. Let's check it with the number. Well in this case we gave it a whole number, so no decimal places. And it told us it's an integer. We could do this with floats with booleans, and it will always very, very helpfully tell us what is the data type. And this is something called type checking. So now it's time for another quick pause check to make sure you understood what's going on. I want you to write out four lines of code to print out the four different data types that we have already learned about. So it's going to be the string, the integer, the float, and the boolean. And we want all four of these printed out in four lines in the output area, using what you've learned and the correct data type to put in inside the parentheses before the type check. So pause the video now and give this a go. All right so we've got already the integer type. So let's put the string one above it. And we know that all strings go inside a set of double quotes. And then we want a floating point number. So we could do a 3.14. And finally, we want a boolean type which we know is either True or False with a capital T and capital F. So now if I hit Run, we should see class str, int, float and bool. The full collection of all the major primitive Python data types that we learned about in the last lesson. If that was confusing at all, review the last lesson and hopefully this all makes perfect sense. Now what if we aren't happy with the assigned data type? What if we want to convert a piece of data into a different data type? Well, then we would need to learn about something called type conversion, also known as type casting in Python. So let's go ahead and clear the board to make this less confusing. And let's start out with a very simple string. So we all know that this is a string because it's enclosed in a set of double quotes. But what if I wanted to turn it into an integer? Well, I can use one of the built-in functions called \"int\" and I can convert this into a number. So whereas previously we saw that if we tried to print the string \"123\" + \"456\", then we would end up with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And because both of these pieces of data are string data types, the plus sign does concatenation instead of maths and adding these two together. But now that we've converted this 1, 2, 3 into an integer, you can see that if we replace this string with this type casted integer and we could do the same for 4, 5, 6. Now if I hit Run, you'll see that it actually treats them as numbers and adds them together. So this is the power of type conversion. Now, one of the dangerous things about this is of course sometimes you can't convert things into a different data type. For example, if I tried to convert, \"ABC\" into a number, well, that doesn't really make sense. If I gave that to you, what would ABC be as a number? I don't know. So if we run this, you can see we get something called a ValueError. So I hope you're collecting these errors in a notebook somewhere because we're coming across lots of them, and you will come across more in your lifetime as a Python developer. So this is saying that there is an invalid literal for the int, which is ABC, and so it doesn't really make sense to convert this into a number is what it's trying to tell you. So you have to be really careful when you're doing type conversions because sometimes you can end up with errors and sometimes you can just simply lose data. But we can use this method to convert things into all of the four major primitive types that we've learned about. So we can convert to an integer, we can convert into a float, we can convert into a string, and we can even convert into a bool. So to check that you've understood how to convert between different data types and why we get different type errors, I have a final pause challenge for you, which is to make this line of code run without errors. So I want you to go ahead and copy this line of code, paste it into your code file, and try to hit run. Now go ahead and enter a name triggered by this input, and then you will see that you get a TypeError. So read through the TypeError, see if you can understand what it's trying to tell you, and fix this code so that it does what you expect it to do, which is to print out the number of letters in the name that the user submits into the input. Pause the video. Give this a go. All right. So in order to break this problem down, let's use some variables to simplify things and make it easier to read. Let's take this second part of this print statement, and let's take it out into separate variables. So we know that we can get the name_of_the_user by using this input() function, and I'm making these variable names extra wordy just so that when you read it, it makes it a little bit more sense. And I'm actually going to delete the rest of this as well, just to make everything easy to read. So next we need the length_of_name, and this is done by using the len() function, and we pass in the name of the user that we got from line one. So now finally, what we have here is the length of the name which we want to tag to the end of this print statement. Now what is this error trying to tell us? It's saying you can only concatenate string to a string, not an integer, which is what it sees in this line of code. So where is the integer? Well, we know that when we calculate the length of something it gives us a number. It gives us a whole number. So this is probably an integer. well, we can verify this by using a type check. Right? We can print the first part of this concatenation, and we can put it inside a type function to check what is the data type of this first part. And then we can also check the data type of the second part, which is now called, length_of_name. So let's comment this out. Let's go ahead and run this code. Enter a name and you can see the first one is a string and the second one is an integer. So this is a type str, and this is a type int. So now it makes sense that when we're printing, we can't simply concatenate a string to a number, it doesn't know how to do that. So how can we convert this length_of_name into the same data type as this first part, which is a string? Well, you learnt how to do that already. All we need to do is to wrap this inside a set of parentheses, which is the string type conversion. And so now we have this part which is now a string, and then we add it to another string. And now if I run this code again then you'll see that it works without any issues. Number of letters in your name:",

And by the end of the day, you will know enough to be able to build this awesome choose-your-own-adventure game. So this is what it looks like when it loads, and our mission is to find the treasure. So it tells us, \"You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Left or right?\" Let's say I want to go left. \"You've come to a lake. There's an island in the middle of the lake. Type 'wait' to wait for a boat. Type 'swim' to swim across.\" I'm going to wait for a boat. \"You arrive at the island unharmed. There's a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which color do you choose?\" Let's choose red. And unfortunately, \"It's a room full of fire. Game over.\" So this game lets the user make decisions and depending on what they've chosen, it continues the game storyline. If you want to have a go at this game, you can head over to this URL or simply click on the link in the Course resources and have a play around with the game. And once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and we're going to start picking up the skills that's going to be required in order to build this game. So I'll see you on the next lesson. Hey, you've reached the final project. And as you've seen at the beginning of today's lessons, I showed you what we're going to be making, which is a sort of, Choose Your Own Adventure Game. I don't know if you've ever read those, \"Choose Your Own Adventure Books,\" where you flip to a different page if you make a particular choice, and then the story kind of evolves as you make your choices. Now we're going to make a very simple version of that using what we've learned about conditionals, if, else, elif statements, as well as everything we've done previously. So you've already seen what the final outcome should look like, and if you want to review it again, just head over to the link in the URL box or click in the Course Resources and it'll direct link you here. And here you'll see essentially the game in action. So it start off asking you, \"You're at a crossroad. Do you want to go left or right?\" And then you have to type your choice. If you selected left, then it's going to take you to a lake, and it asks you whether if you want to wait for a boat or swim across. So let's go ahead and wait for a boat. And then the final step is it asks you, which door would you like to go through red, yellow or blue? Now, depending on your choice, you'll either end up with Game Over or you'll end up with winning the game. So the basic setup for this game looks something like this. And I've included a link to the flowchart in the starting project right here. And of course, you'll find all the links in the Course Resources as always. Now, the first question you're going to ask the user is to make a choice between left and right. Now you can use my wording if you want, \"You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type 'left' or type 'right'.\" But I think the fun part of this challenge is really creating your own story, right? But somehow get them to choose between left and right. If they choose right or any other condition for that matter, tell them that they've lost, 'Game Over' for some sort of reason. In my case, if they had chosen right, the reason is because they fell into a hole, Game Over. But I think you're far more imaginative than I am, so go ahead and use all of those skills and make your game really fun. Now, if they've chosen left, on the other hand, then we're going to take them to another question that asks them whether they want to swim or whether if they want to wait for a boat. And if they swam, then it's going to be some form of Game Over. There's crocodiles, there's...whatever it may be, but they can't continue. But if they chose wait, then we take them to the third and final question, which asks them to choose between three doors and if they choose any door other than the yellow door, then they would lose, but if they chose the yellow door, then they somehow win. Now notice how each of these just says, Game Over, Game Over, left or right, but you know, the idea is really to use your creativity and make this game really your own. Now, one thing to remember, though, is that when the user types in an answer, let's say left or right, they might type it like this with an uppercase R, or they might type it like this, all lowercase. Have a think about how you might make sure that no matter which version they typed, you're still going to be able to catch their command essentially. So have a think about what you've learned in the previous lessons and take a look at this flowchart, then head over to the starting project and you can get started writing your code. Now ASCII art is really cool because it basically just uses a bunch of characters that you know and love, like the comma and the equal sign and all of these things that together make up a picture. And you can find your own ASCII art if you just go to, ascii.co.uk/art, and you'll see a whole bunch of different topics. And they've grouped a lot of things together into individual pages. So if you wanted a Rhino ASCII art, then you can find a whole bunch of rhinos that people have drawn. But the easiest way is, of course, using cmd + F if you're on a Mac, or Ctrl + F if you're on a Windows machine, and then just search for the thing that you want. So, for example, I went and searched for treasure, and down here I found this brilliant Treasure Box in ASCII art, which is what I'm using to print inside this print statement. Now notice how there's three single quotes that are at the start, and there's three single quotes at the end. Basically, what the single quotes allow you to do is to create multiple lines of a string essentially. So notice how if I go ahead and delete all of these single quotes and I only had a set of double quotes then it actually doesn't quite work. It gets quite confused because it thinks that this is where the line ends, but in fact, I wanted it to print all of this out. So to do that, instead of using a double quote, I use three single quotes, and at the very bottom, I tell it well, this is the end of my multi-block string by using three single quotes as well. So have a go at running that, and you should be able to see that in your console, you get this little Treasure Island ASCII art being printed along with the two sentences that begin the game. So have a look at the flowchart, have a play around with the ASCII art, and also have a look at the final version of the app so that you can go ahead and create your own version to complete this challenge. Pause the video now and give that a go. All right. So let's see if we can replicate the functionality or the logic that's shown in this diagram into our Treasure Island game. So the first thing it has to do is we have to ask the user whether, if they want to turn left or right. And after we ask the user this question, we're going to want to capture their input. Right? So let's go ahead and create an input() function and ask our question. Now notice how when I use my double quotes around my string, the double quotes that are inside the double quotes are interpreted as code, because it actually thinks that this is the end of the first string. This is the second string, and this is the final string. This is how the computer is going to see it. Now there's a cool thing that we can do in Python. When we have a string like this, we can enclose a string inside a set of double quotes. And let's say we have a string in here, \"Say the words... She said: \"hello.\" \" Now, if we want these double quotes to occur and to be viewed as a part of the text, one trick that we can do is instead of using double quotes to enclose our string, we can actually use single quotes around it, instead. And because now we have double quotes inside the single quotes, it will be interpreted as text. And you can see everything inside here is all green. Now, if we try to apply this trick to our input on this line here, there's one slight problem. So let me show you. I'm going to get rid of the final double quote of our string and the first double quote of our string. I'm going to highlight the entire string that I would like to be a part of, the input prompt text, and I'm going to type the single quote button to wrap everything inside. Now we've solved the problem with the double quotes, but we also have a single quote in our sentence. So now what the computer thinks you're trying to do is here's a string, starting single quote, ending single quote. I've written a bunch of other code, and then I've got some other strings left and right. And at the end I've somehow forgotten to close that quote. So how can we fix this? Well, a really, really simple thing is to simply use the backslash button (\\), which is used as an escape symbol in programming. So what this says is yes, this is a backslash, but if the backslash occurs in front of any other useful symbol, then it will mean that we're trying to escape this symbol, so don't interpret it as code, and instead, if we run our code, you'll see the input printout in its entirety. 'You\\'re at a crossroad...'with the apostrophe. 'Where do you want to go? Type \"left\" or \"right\".' And it's exactly what we wanted to happen. Now, of course, there's other ways that you could have gone around this. You could have just simply said, \"You are at...\"at a crossroad rather than using the apostrophe. But more often than not, you'll need to use a symbol that you'll need to escape, and you can do that with the backslash. So that's just a quick tip. Now at this point, the user is going to type a message, \"left\" or \"right.\" So let's go ahead and save that to a variable. Let's call it choice1, equals their input. Now remember how I said they could be typing the answer as Right or as right, so how can we make sure that when we're doing our checks using the if statement we ignore the casing? Well, one way of doing this is we can simply use the lower() function to change their input, no matter how they wrote it: Right, right, or RIGHT, it should all be converted into lower case, to this version. That way we have one thing that we can consistently check for in our if statement, which is coming up next. So we can say if choice1 ==, remember the double equals is checking whether if left-hand side and right-hand side is equal, and the single equal sign is assigning the right-hand side to this particular variable name. Now if choice1 equals the string \"right\", then it's pretty much game over for our player. So let's go ahead and add our colon and print something like Game Over. Of course, we can elaborate this a little bit more as to why was it game over? Well, because you fell into a hole. This is like the E.T. game from the 80s. Lots of holes. so, \"You fell into a hole. Game Over.\" But what if they had chosen left instead? Well, that takes them on to the next question. So that's the option that will allow them to continue along the game. Now in this case, we could use an else statement and say, well, if they didn't choose right, then they probably chose left, right? But they could have also chosen like an option that was completely not listed. They could have just written something like this, and it would still trigger the else statement. So what we should actually do is to switch it around. So namely, we should say if choice1 is equal to left, well, in that case then they continue in the game, but otherwise, namely, if they chose right or anything else for that matter, then it's pretty much Game Over. So this format makes a lot more sense if you want to continue along the left side of the branch, this way. Now, another thing that you might have realized, because we learned about combining different conditions, is instead of using the .lower() to change the input to lowercase, you could have also said if choice is equal to left, or if choice1 is equal to left spelled like this, that will both work. But I think in terms of succinctness and less code writing, I think this makes a lot more sense to me. So I'm going to continue with this version. But if you did it the other way, that's perfectly valid as well. Now, if their choice1 was left, then they get taken to the next question. \"Do you want to swim or do you want to wait?\" So let's go ahead and continue the game and create another input. In this input, we're going to ask them a question and say, \"You've come to a lake, there is an island in the middle of the lake. Type 'wait' to wait for a boat. Type 'swim' to swim across.\" Cool. So we've actually got the same problem as we had before. Namely, that this is being interpreted as code rather than as a continuous single string. So do you remember how we fixed this previously? And if you got stuck on this, I recommend having a go at this yourself before I show you the answer. All right. So previously, we said we were going to switch it to single quotes instead so that these double quotes become interpreted as just normal strings. But of course we've got this, \"You've\", we could, of course, change it to, you have instead of \"you've\", but if we want to escape the string, we just add a backslash, which is exactly what we did previously. Now, one thing you might notice here is I'm getting a warning here saying PEP 8... So this is a style guidance. This line is too long. And you might have also felt a little bit annoyed having to scroll left and right constantly to be able to see the end of the line. So what can we do in this case? Well, we can actually very easily pick any point in our entirely long string and just hit Enter, and it will automatically do the right thing and make it go on to the next line. Now, this doesn't actually change how it gets printed out, because if I go ahead and stop this and run this code again, you can see it's still typing everything on the same line. \"You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type left or right?\" It doesn't actually affect it at all. The only thing it does is it helps our code to be more readable. So we can go ahead and fix this one as well. So wherever you choose, just hit Enter. I did it at the end of a sentence because that makes more sense, but you don't have to. You can actually even put it in the middle of a character if you really wanted to. Now here we're going to see a new warning, and it's basically unhappy with how our indentation looks for this separated second part of the string. So when you hover over some of these PEP 8 warnings, you can actually just click on this button for them to do whatever they think is best. You know, it's like, \"All right, you do it, you know, leave me alone and just fix it for me.\" So they fixed it for us. And as usual with AI and machines it now looks like I have to scroll horizontally again. So let me just fix this so that I put each sentence on a new line so I can see everything in one go without having to scroll around. It's quite good for my sanity. Now, one thing you have to be really careful about is this indentation. Now, this indentation here doesn't really matter at all. It's just all for styling. And the computer was unhappy with having it unaligned with the start of the string. So that's why they asked us to fix it. But the thing that really matters is your code's indentation, because this choice2, getting the input from the user for the second question must be indented inside this if statement, because otherwise it's going to give you an IndentationError. And this means that only when the choice for the first question was left do we actually prompt them for an input and let them continue the story. And then we get to check our choice2. So if choice2 is equal to \"wait\" then it means that the game will continue, but else, so if they typed \"swim\" or anything else for that matter, then the game is going to end. So we're going to print and tell them that something terrible happened, \"You got attacked by an angry trout. Game Over.\" Now we can continue along this path. So we're down to here now. And the final question we're going to ask the user is which door do they want to choose. So here I'm going to use an input to send them the message that, \"You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow, one blue. Which color do you choose?\" Now I'm going to save their choice inside a variable called choice3, lowercase, the answer that they provided, and finally, I'm going to use if, elif, and else to check which one they chose. So if choice3 is equal to \"red\", elif choice3 is equal to \"yellow\", elif choice3 is equal to \"blue\". And then I've got an else. So here are four possible things that could happen if they chose red, then I'm going to tell them that it's game over, but it's going to be some sort of creative version of Game Over. So maybe something like, \"It's a room full of fire. Game over.\" If they chose yellow, on the other hand, well, that's going to be the room where the treasure exists. So I'm going to print , \"You found the treasure. You win!\" If they chose blue, they also end up with Game Over. And I have to give them a different reason. Now, if you had decided that if they chose anything but yellow, the way that they're going to Game Over is the same. Say, if you know, if you chose red, \"It's a room full of fire. Game Over.\" If you chose blue, \"It's a room full of fire. Game Over.\" Anything else, it's also going to be fire, Game Over. Well, then you could just use if and else. But if you wanted each choice or each door to have a different outcome for the user, say the red door has fire, the blue door has beasts, and if they chose the wrong door, then they're going to get something like, \"You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over.\" So can you see that depending on whether if you want to give the user a different print statement, based on their choice, then you would use if, elif, else, but if you actually just wanted to give them the same feedback, which is \"Game Over\", then you could just use if and else. Now let's run our game and just make sure that it works. So I'm going to go left because I know it continues. And then I'm going to wait for the boat. And that allows me to get to the final condition, and if I choose yellow, I know that I'll win. Now if you want to change the formatting, because having the input at the end of the sentence doesn't look as good as letting the user type it on a new line, then you can simply, if you remember, just add the new line which is \\n at the end of your inputs, like so. So how did you get on with this challenge? And if you didn't manage to do it right, or if you've done it right, go back and try and modify it. See if you can add some more conditions, or see if you can make the \"Game Over\" messages a little bit more interesting than what I've written. See if you can modify and make it really your own. Have fun with that. And in the next lesson, I've got more exciting things coming up for you, so hopefully you've scheduled some time for tomorrow to complete the next day's lessons. But for now, it's good night from me. Hey, I hope you had fun building the Treasure Island project. Now remember that the most important thing when it comes to programming and learning this new skill is to really make the code your own. So with this project, really the sky's the limit. You can take your creativity and run with it. Make the story, your own, change it up, change the game. Make it something that you imagined it to be. And I can't wait to play your game. So once you've created your own version, be sure to share it in the comments below so we can all play it and we can all admire your hard work. So have a go at that and I'll see you tomorrow. Here's a question, have you ever sat in your bath and wondered, why is it that no matter how forgetful I am, my bath never overflows like this? This is something I was thinking about the other day, and I realized that it's not because I'm particularly diligent, I forget stuff all the time. I mean pizza, anyone? It's what my pizzas usually look like. But the reason why our bathtub or the sink doesn't overflow is because of this fantastic piece of engineering, the overflow. So this means that whenever the water reaches beyond a certain level about here, the water starts overflowing so that the bathtub doesn't overflow and annoy your neighbors downstairs. In fact, we could represent this mechanism with a conditional statement. When the water level is, say, greater than 80cm, then it should drain the water. But if the water level is not greater than 80cm, it should continue filling up the tub. This type of conditional statement is known as an if / else statement. Depending on a particular condition, we would do either A or B, and when we want to write Python code to represent this, it looks something like this. There's the keyword, if, and then the condition that we're testing for, and then a colon. And after the colon we've got an indented block of code which should be executed if this condition is met, if it's true, but if it's not true, then we will skip to the else block and it's just the else keyword with a colon. And then this code block would execute if the condition is false. So we could represent that previous bathtub situation with code that looks a bit like this. Let's say our water level is at 50cm, and then we would test if the water level is greater than 80cm. Well, if that is the case, then we should drain the water, but if it's not greater than 80cm, in other words, else. Well, in this case, we should just continue filling up the bathtub. Let's put this into practice with a real life problem. Now, let's say that you've gotten a job at a theme park, and your first job of the day is to write some code that replaces the ticket box. Now there's a couple of things that you'll need to think about. Firstly, in order for somebody to actually purchase a ticket to go on the roller coaster ride, they will need to be over 120cm. So we have to check what their height is, because if they're too short, then we won't be able to sell them a ticket anyways. In the Course resources I've included a link to this flow chart that I've created on Draw.io. This is a really, really useful tool for creating any sort of flow charts or diagrams, and it's really easy to use. Now, if we take a look at this flow chart, this is basically the logic that we have to program using our if and else statements. If the person who is trying to purchase a ticket is not over 120cm, then they can't ride on the roller coaster, but if their height is greater than 120cm, then they can ride. So let's try it out. All that I've got here is a print statement that says, \"Welcome to the roller coaster!\" as well as an input asking the user for their height in centimeters and then converting the string into a whole number, an integer, and then I'm storing it inside this variable called height. Now we're going to check whether if the height that the user is typed in is greater than 120. So we use the keyword if and then we check if the height is greater than 120, and then we add the colon. And now when I hit Enter, you'll notice that the code editor has automatically indented me slightly over. I'm not over here, because in Python the spacing and indentation is really, really important. It tells the computer that the code that I'm about to write is what should be executed when this condition is met. So what should happen if your height is over 120? Then we will just print, \"You can ride the roller coaster.\" But what should we print if height is not greater than 120? Well, in this case we would use the else statement to catch when that happens. And it's really important that you don't write the else here because this is indented over. Instead, you want it to be at the same indentation level as the if statement. These two are essentially a pair if and else. Now after the else keyword, we again add a colon, and then we hit enter. And we're now indented again. And here we can write the code that should happen if this condition is false. \"Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.\" So the really important things here are the condition which we're testing for, is the value of height greater than 120. The syntax of this code. So the keywords if and else, as well as the colons that come after each of these lines. And finally also the indentation. Everything that is indented after the if is a block of code. So this is indented and it's effectively inside this if. So this line of code lives inside the else statement. This block of code lives inside the if statement. and if you mess up on the indentation, then you're probably going to get an IndentationError telling you that this line five probably should be indented. But when we do actually correct it and we hit Run, let's say that our height is 130cm, then we get back, \"You can ride the roller coaster.\" But if our height was, say, 90cm, then we get a different outcome. We get, \"Sorry you have to grow taller before you can ride.\" So by using if and else statements, we're able to get our code to do different things, either printing this line or printing this line depending on a condition that we're testing for. Now, when we use this greater than sign (&gt;) effectively, what we're saying is that is the height greater than 120, which means that it does not include 120. In fact, if I run this code and if I type in my height as 120, then it actually goes into the else block and prints this. So if we wanted to include 120cm so that all the people who are exactly 120cm can ride the roller coaster, then instead of just using a greater than symbol, we have to write greater than or equals (&gt;=). So these two symbols have to be next to each other. And now when I run my code and I write 120, you'll see that it's now falling into this block of code. And it's telling me that I can ride the roller coaster. Now, these are called comparison operators, and we've already seen Greater Than. So Lesser than is pretty self-explanatory, but we've also seen greater than or equal to and lesser than or equal to. So if you want to include a particular number or particular value when you do these comparisons, you would be using these instead. Now in this table there's also the equal to and not equal to. For example, if you wanted to check if somebody's height is equal to precisely 120, then you would use two equal signs. And very often it gets a little bit confusing, especially if you're new to programming when you're typing equal signs. Because sometimes we're typing one and other times we're typing two. It's important to remember that when you have one equal sign, it means that you're assigning this value to this variable. But when you have two equal signs, you're checking to see if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right. And they're completely different. Now, the good thing is that when you get it wrong, usually you'll get enough clues in the error to actually hint to you, hey, maybe there's something that's wrong here, right? Because the syntax doesn't look right. For this to be a condition, it has to be something that evaluates to true or to false. And height equals 120 does not evaluate to either. So by changing it to this we're saying if height is equal to 120 then we'll execute this line of code or any other lines which are in the same block of code. But if the height is not equal to 120, then we're going to execute this block of code. So if I write 120 then that works. But if I write 121 then it does not work. Similarly, you can also check for not equals to which just flips it around. But in our case it makes sense to say if the height is greater than or equals to 120, then you can ride the roller coaster, but otherwise, you cannot ride the roller coaster. By using if and else statements, we can get our computer to do different things and respond differently depending on different conditions. So in the next lesson, I've got a coding exercise for you, I'll see you there. All right. In this lesson, we're going to learn about a new operator. So similar to the other mathematical operators and the conditional operators, an operator is just a symbol in programming that has a specific function. So what is the modulo operator? Well, it looks a bit like a percentage sign, but it's not just the percentage sign. Instead it goes in between two numbers. So hence a binary operator, and it works out what is the remainder after the division. So 10 / 5 = 2. And this division is clean because five goes into ten two times and there's no remainder. So therefore ten modulo five, if we were to print this out would give us the result of zero (10 % 5 = 0), no remainder in this division. So here's a challenge for you. What is 10 % 3? If 10 / 3 is 3.333333... recurring, because ten does not divide cleanly into three, what do you think would be the result of 10 % 3 on a computer? Pause and have a think about it. Okay, so let's go through the solution together. If ten divided by three is equal to three with some decimal places, that means ten does not divide cleanly into three. Ten divided by three is equal to three with one as the remainder. So that means 10 % 3  is going to equal to 1, because all that the modulo does is it performs a division and then gives us how many is remaining after that division. So armed with that knowledge, you are now ready to tackle another coding challenge. And in this coding challenge, I want you to write some code to check whether the number inserted in the input area so typed by a user is odd or even, so you'll need to get hold of what they type in the input area. You'll need to convert it into an integer number, and then you'll need to use an if statement to check and see if you were to modulo that number, is it going to have a remainder? And remember that even numbers, when you use the modulo, so for example let's take an even number, 12. If you use the modulo and you divide that number by two, it's always going to be equal to zero, because any even number divided by two should divide cleanly. So if it divides cleanly with no remainder, then it is an even number. So have a think about this and see if you can complete this challenge. And then later on, in a minute, we will pause the video and then I will come back and explain the solution together. So give it a go now. Okay, so the first thing we need to do is to get hold of an input. Now, it doesn't matter what you ask. You could say, \"What is the number you want to check?\" And this is going to come out onto here. And then once the user types a number, that number needs to be stored and converted into an integer. So let's do the type conversion first. And then let's create a variable called, number_to_check, and set it equal to this right-hand side. So let's just confirm that that worked. Let's go ahead and hit Run, type in a number, and it gets printed. So that's all working as expected. Now the next thing we need to do is to actually check the number. So if we print the number_to_check % 2, to check if it's even, then we can try this out with some different inputs. So let's try 12. Modulo is zero. Now what if we try an odd number. Let's try a three. Then we get modulo gives us an output of one. So 3 % 2, has a remainder of one, which means it's not even because it does not cleanly divide into two. Let's try another odd number 19. So you can see from this experiment or your knowledge of maths, whatever we take and we modulo it by two if it's equal to zero, if this result is equal to zero, then that means that this number is an even number. So instead of printing this we can use an if statement. If number_to_check % 2 == 0: Now, on an indented line of code, we can say print. Well, this is obviously going to be an even number, and otherwise, so else, then we can print that this is an odd number. So let's just add one space here so that when I run this my cursor just has one space beyond the question mark. Let's check some numbers. 45 is odd, which is true. 34 should be even. So this is reasonably simple, but it's also quite hard because it uses two things that you've learnt, and it combines them together. So hopefully you managed to get this to work and you manage to write the code yourself. If not, head back to your code and fix it so that it works, after you have seen the solution. There's no shame in seeing the solution, it's all a part of the learning process. Don't worry if you didn't get it first time. There's a lot of things that I didn't get first time as well, but the important thing is you write down notes and you understand what is explained in the lessons so that you're ready to tackle the next challenge. In previous lessons, we learned about using the if and else statements to check whether if somebody is over 120cm or not, and allow them to actually purchase a ticket if they are over a certain height. Now, in addition to the height, there's another condition that we need to check for, namely their age. If somebody is over 18 years old, then they should be paying the adult price, which is let's say $12, but if they are 18 or under, then they should only be paying $7. So how can we represent this extra condition that we need to check for in our code? Well, we could use something called a nested if else statement. We've seen our if else statements look like this, where it's only got two choices, if this condition is true, do this, otherwise do that. But in a nested if statement, once the first condition has passed, we can check for another condition, and then we can have another if else statement inside this if condition. In order for this thing to happen, this has to be true, and this also has to be true. In order for this to happen, this condition has to be true, but this condition has to be false. So essentially the computer first looks at the larger picture, which is this first condition, and decides on whether if it should go into the else block here or if it should go into the nested block inside the if statement. So now this is what our flowchart looks like, in the first if statement, we check whether if their height is over 120cm, if no, then the if statements all end. You can't write, you can't buy a ticket. But if yes, we actually take them to yet another if statement where we check their age. If their age is 18 or under, then we give them a $7 ticket. If they're over 18, then they have to pay $12. So the place where we're going to nest, our if statement is inside here. Notice how it's indented. So it's already inside this if block. And this already has to be true. Now here we're going to create another if and else statement. And the condition checks for their age. So we better ask them for an age. Let's say age equals, convert the input to an int. And, \"What is your age?\" So now that we've gotten hold of their age, we can see if their age is less than or equal to 18. Well in this case we're going to give them the $7 ticket. But else namely if this is not true, if their age is over 18, well, in that case, we're going to give them the $12 ticket. So now we have a nested if statement because this if and else statement lives inside this if statement. So this condition will only be checked if this is already deemed to be true. Now let's say our situation got a little bit more complex. The boss comes over, checks our code and says, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's actually more price tiers than that. In fact, if you're less than 12 years old, you pay $5. If you're between 12 and 18, you pay $7. And if you're over 18, then you pay the full adult price, which is $12. Now there are three possibilities. So how do we represent this in our if statement? Well, we could use something called the elif. Instead of having a simple if else statement where there's only one condition, if it's true, do this, otherwise do that. You can add as many elif conditions as you want. So we can check for condition1, if that's true, then do A, but if that's not true, then we can continue and check for condition2. If condition2 is true, well then we can do B. And finally, if none of those conditions were true, we can do this final thing. Our flowchart now looks something like this, and this is the logic that we're trying to program. Once we're inside this nested if statement, we're going to check if their age is under 12, in which case they should pay $5. If they're between 12 and 18, then they should pay $7. And finally, if they're over 18, then they should pay $12. Now, the first thing I'm going to check is if the age is less than 12 under this condition, they should pay $5. So let's change that to 5. Now the next condition should be created using an elif, which stands for else-if. So, it means, if this is not true, else if, can you check if this is true? Well, in that case then we should do this. For example, if the age is not less than 12, so they're over 12, then are they under 18? Well then this condition basically catches everybody who's between 12 and 18. And finally, if they're not less than or equal to 18 and they're not less than 12, then that's everybody else who is over 18. Now remember that we can use as many elif conditions between the if and else as we like. So I could add another elif that checks whether if the age is less than, say, 22. Well, in this case, do something else, and then I can keep going with these elif's until I'm done with all my conditions. So have a play around with this code. Write it yourself, see if it makes sense, and then mess around with the elif\"s so that it does what you expect it to do. And then once you're ready, go ahead and head over to the next lesson where I've got a coding challenge for you. Now in the last lesson, we saw how we could use if / elif /else to check for multiple conditions, but in this case we're only checking one condition, even though we have multiple. Because if this first condition is true, then we would do whatever it is we need to do and then we would bypass everything else. Now what if you're in a situation where you need to check for multiple conditions, even if the previous one was already true. Coming back to our roller coaster ticketing problem, if you're going on a good roller coaster ride, you'd probably want to keep a picture for the memories, right? And our roller coaster is no exception. We want to be able to charge users an extra $3 if they want to purchase a ticket that includes a photo. Now, this is quite interesting because this is completely independent of their age or their height, even if we've already gotten their age and height and determined their ticket price. This is an extra question. Do you want a photo or not? Yes or no? If you do, then we're going to add $3 to your existing ticket price. To do this we would write multiple if conditions. If condition1 is true, then do A, but then the code is going to go to the next case and check if condition2 is also true, in which case it will do B, and if the final condition is also true, it's going to do C. Whereas on the example on the left here, only one of these things, A, B or C will be carried out. Comparing the example on the left where we're using, If / elif / else only one of these things, A, B, or C will be carried out. But on the right-hand side, all three conditions are checked, and if it so happens that all three conditions are true, then A, B, and C will all be executed. Currently our code operates like this. We check for their height, if they are over 120cm, we check their age, and depending on their age, we give them a different price ticket. What we now want is even after we've checked for their ticket price, we want to ask them a question. Do you want photos with your ticket? And if the answer is yes, then we're going to add $3 to their bill, no matter which type of ticket they've got. And finally we give them the total bill. If they say no, then we jump straight to the total bill and just tell them the price of their ticket. So how do we implement this in our code? Well, first let's change these print statements instead of giving them the bill at each of these steps, I'm going to tell them which type of ticket they're eligible for. So the next thing to do is to ask them whether if they want a photo or not. So I'm going to need to use an input, but the question is where do I put that? Now the correct answer is that it has to be at the same indentation level as this if block. So you can imagine this whole thing with the if, elif, and else as sort of belonging together, because they all relate to one thing. What is their age, and which type of ticket are they eligible for? Now, outside of that if statement, I'm going to create an input and ask the user, \"Do you want a photo taken?\" Type y for yes or n for no? And then I'm going to save that input inside a variable called wants_photo. So now I'm going to use an if statement to check what their answer was. If it was true then I'm going to add $3, and if it was false I'm just going to skip to giving them their ticket price. So here is where I write my if statement. Notice how it's at the same indentation level as this previous set of if statements, but it's not at the same indentation level as this set of if statement. So essentially what's happening is once I've checked their age, then I'm going to check whether if they want a photo or not. And this is going to apply to everybody, no matter their age. So if wants_photo is equal to y, well, in this case I'm going to go and add $3 to their bill. But how can I add $3 to the bill when I don't have a variable to vary. So instead of using these print statements, I'm going to create a variable up here called bill, and I'm going to set it to equal zero. Now in addition to printing to the user how much their ticket is, I'm going to set the bill to the price that they're supposed to pay. So if age is less than 12, bill is equal to five. If age is less than 18, then bill is equal to seven. And finally, for everybody else the bill is equal to 12. So now depending on these conditions, the variable bill is going to be changed to a different number. But once we land in this if statement I'm going to have to add $3 to their bill, no matter which value it is at the moment. So effectively, what I want to do is bill equals the current value of bill plus three. So if bill was seven, then this new value of bill should be ten. If bill was 12 then it should now be 15. Now in Python as well as many other languages. There's actually a slightly shorter way of writing this when you want to increase the current value that's held in a variable and you want to save it back into the variable, you can simply write plus equals (+=). So bill +=3 is the same as bill = bill + 3. Now no matter what the value of the bill is before it reaches this if statement I'm still going to add $3 to it. Now after this if statement is completed, I don't actually have to write a companion else statement because in this case, if the answer is no, then we're simply going to do nothing. We're not going to do anything to the bill. Instead, I'm just going to skip ahead and print the user their final bill. And I'm going to use f-strings to insert the value that the bill variable has into this print statement. Now for your code to work, the indentation matters a huge deal because the computer will think you want it to do different things depending on the indentation. So notice how this indentation shows that this bill + 3 is to be executed when this condition is true. But this print statement is not indented to the same level, and effectively it's going to happen after this if statement has been executed. So you can play around with indenting this print statement and indenting it and see what the difference is. But now I'm going to go ahead and run my code and try and get a ticket. So let's say that I am 21 years old, it tells me that, \"Adult tickets are $12.\" And then it ask me, \"Do you want a photo taken?\" So yeah, I would love to have a photo taken. And it tells me that my final bill is 15, so I've got a dollar sign here. But effectively it's now added the $3 to the $12 because of this additional if statement. So if this concept is still a little bit confusing to you, then I want you to really study this flowchart and just look at the difference, and visualize it, because the if / elif / else statement is only ever going to be true in one of these arrows. Right? You can't be less than 12 and 18 and over. And similarly, it doesn't make sense for you to have two different ticket prices. But with the want photos, this condition has to be asked no matter which ever branch they landed on. So it's completely separate from this if statement. And once you've had a look at this flowchart, then compare it against the code. And the way that the code works should be a lot more obvious. And once you're happy with the code and this concept, then I want you to head over to the next lesson where I've got a code challenge for you. So for all of that and more, I'll see you there. All right, guys, in this lesson, I have a small coding challenge for you. The goal is to create a Python Pizza Delivery Program, and the program is going to automatically calculate the bill for the user based on a number of options. So the user is going to be asked three questions in the form of an input. And we can run through this program as it is just to see that in action. So firstly it says, \"Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!\" \"What size pizza do you want?\" And I'm going to choose a large pizza. So it asks me S, M or L? So L. \"Do you want pepperoni on your pizza?\" Yes, always. And then it asks, \"Do you want extra cheese?\" I'll type N for no. So these are my inputs which will get saved into these variables: size, pepperoni, and extra_cheese. And what I want to happen is for us to be able to print out the final bill, saying, \"Your final bill is...\" this amount, and it should be $28 based on the pricing of Python Pizza. So you can see in the description box here we've got all the prices for the Small, Medium, and Large pizzas as well as the modifiers. So if they want pepperoni on a small pizza, that's an extra $2. If they want pepperoni on a medium or large pizza, that's an extra $3. And finally, if they want extra cheese, that's $1 on top of their bill. So your goal is to use what you've learned about if statements, elif statements, else statements, nested if statements, multiple if statements, everything you've learned so far, basically in today's lessons, to be able to build this and get it to do what we expect it to do. So pause the video, have a think about how you might tackle this problem, and work through each of the TODO's in order. Afterwards, come back and we'll go through the solution together. By the way, in this lesson, you can click on the check button, once you think your code is doing what it's supposed to, and we'll run through the automatic test using various options that we've tried for size pepperoni and extra cheese to verify that your code works. So pause the video now. All right, so let's run through the solution together. The first thing we want to do is to work out how much they need to pay based on their size choice. So we've got all the prices here. And we're going to start off with a variable called bill, that's going to start out at zero. And we're going to check the variable size. So if the size that they chose is equal to \"S\", that means they wanted a small pizza, so then to the bill we will simply add $15. Now at this point, because this is the very first if statement. And we're simply setting the bill depending on the size that they chose, you might have done it differently. You might have done this, you might have said, let's set the bill to equal 15 instead of plus equals. Both of them work and both of them are acceptable solutions. Now I'm going to stick to using the +=, because we're going to be using it a lot in this program. So hopefully you already understand that this is the same as saying plus 15 to the previous value of bill and set it to the new value. So the next thing we need to check is what if they chose a medium sized pizza? So we're going to use elif and we're going to check the second condition. If size that they chose is equal to M, in this case we're going to add $20 to the bill. So we're going to say bill += 20. And the final version, so the L, if they chose a large pizza we need to set it to $25. Now, there's two options here. You might have done an else statement because we've already tackled S and M. The last one is just L. So we could simply set the bill += 25. But you might have also added a another elif statement. So again both of these options work. We can say elif size == \"L\". Depends on what you want to choose, but both of these options will work just fine. Now you might also want to add a final else statement if you are really careful, because what if they typed something wrong? What if they typed instead of S, M, and L, they typed some mumbo jumbo? Well, that would be tackled in the else statement, and you could print out, \"You typed the wrong inputs,\" just to catch that situation. Now I have a warning sign under my print statement, and it tells me that my indentation is not a multiple of four. So just in case this happens to you, just make sure that every time you use an indent that you've got four spaces in there. So if I just add one more space and make sure that all of these are on the same indentation line, that warning goes away. So we're done with the first to do. We've worked out how much to add to the build based on the user's size choice. The next thing to do is to figure out if they chose any pepperoni. So if pepperoni is equal to Y, then in that case we need to add some money to their bill. But how much? Well, it depends on the size of their previous choice. So if they had a small pizza, it's $2. And if they had a large pizza it's $3. So the easiest way to do this is to use a nested if statement. So inside the previous if statement, we've already checked to make sure that they chose Y for pepperoni. So yes to pepperoni if we add another if statement here, this will only be checked if they already said they wanted pepperoni. So if the size is equal to S, then this is the case of a pepperoni on a small sized pizza. So to the bill we can add $2 now. Else, so they chose, \"Yes\" to pepperoni, but they have a different size. Then we can say the bill should add equal $3, and that solves the pepperoni problem with a nested if statement inside another if statement. So the final to do is to work out their final amount based on whether if they want extra cheese. So this is a situation where we have multiple if statements. So we have an if statement here that's being checked. We have an if statement here that's being checked. And finally we have an if statement that checks if they want extra cheese. So if this is equal to yes, then all we need to do is, add the $1 to the bill. And that is all we need to do to complete this last, addition. And now we can finally print out the value where we say, \"Your final bill is...\" and then colon, and then a dollar sign. And then we're going to use an f-string to insert the amount for our bill right here. And finally we need a full stop. Now make sure that you've actually got everything written exactly as I have, because otherwise the checks are not going to pass. So now that I've made sure I've got all the right full stops and, all the right wording, and hopefully my calculations are correct, I can now click on check and if everything is correct then it tells me congratulations, everything's correct. So hopefully that wasn't too hard and you managed to figure it out by yourself. If not, this is the time to go back and fix your code based on what you've learned in the solutions. We all make mistakes and we all need help to figure out things. There's nothing wrong with learning from the solution. Walkthrough. As long as you understand everything that's going on. So go ahead and do that if you need to. Otherwise, head over to the next lesson where we're going to learn about logical operators. Now, up to this point you've seen us use if statements, else statements, elif statements, multiple if statements as well as nested if statements, but the thing that we haven't been able to do thus far is to check for multiple conditions in the same line of code. So how would we be able to combine different conditions and say, well, is the pizza large, and the user wants pepperoni, and extra cheese all in the same line of code. Well, to do this, we would need to learn about the logical operators. So there's three of them that are really useful: \"and\", \"or\", and \"not\". So let's take a look at the first one. When you combine two different conditions using an and operator they both have to be True both A and B for the entire line of code to be True. If just one of them is True, say A is True and B is False, or A is False and B is True, then the overall thing evaluates to False. Now let's try out some of that in actual code. So let's go ahead and go into the Python Console that we see, right here. And here we can write Python code from scratch, so completely independent of everything else and independent of our code files. So let's test out some Python code in here. Let's say that, a = 12. Right? Now, let's say that I wanted to check whether if is a &gt; 15? Well, that is going to be False. Now what about is a &gt; 10? Well, that's going to be True. Now, if I combined this using an \"and\" statement, I could say, well, is a &gt; 10 and a &lt; 13 and hit Enter, then I would get, True, because both a is greater than ten and a is less than 13 are True. So in this case, when both conditions are true, then this entire line gets evaluated to True. But see what happens when just one of them is False. So is a &gt; 15 and a &lt; 13, a is greater than 15 is False, a is less than 13 is True, and now we get False . So that's what happens when you combine different conditions using and. So using the \"and\" logical operator it looks at two conditions, and to see if they are both True. And if they are both True it becomes True as the final outcome. But if either of these are False, so False and True becomes False. True and False also becomes False. And this is how the and logical operator works. Now if you only needed one of the conditions to be True, then you could use the \"or\" operator instead. So if C or D were True, or if they're both True, then it will evaluate to True. It's only when both C and D are False, does this statement actually become False. Now the final one is the \"not\" operator. And all that this does is it basically reverses a condition. So if the condition is False, then it becomes True. If it's True, then it becomes False. So coming back to our code, we can refresh and restart the Python Console and start with the same a = 12 . And we can use the or statement by saying, well, is a &gt; 10. That's True, or is a &lt; 10, which is not True. So here we have a condition that is True and a condition that's not True, but because this time instead of using an and, we have an or, between these two conditions, then this will actually evaluate to True. So in this case, using the or True or True will become True. True or False will become True. False or True becomes true and it's only False or False when both of the conditions are False does it actually evaluate to False. So this is quite different from the \"and\" operator. Now finally with the \"not\" operator, it only works when the condition that's being checked is False. So effectively it flips the True to the False and False to True. Let me show you what I mean. So we know that a is 12, so is a &lt; 0? Well it's not because it's 12. It's definitely not less than zero. But by putting the not in front of it, it reverses the condition. So a &lt; 0, this will evaluate to False, but putting the not in front of it it becomes True. So not False is True, and not True is False. Coming back to our roller coaster ticketing, let's say that the roller coaster company decided that for everybody who is having a midlife crisis, they would give them free tickets. And according to Wikipedia, midlife crises typically occur when you are 45 to 55 years old. Let's see if we can incorporate this into our code. So let's say that in addition to these existing price categories, what if you had to add a separate price category for those people who are aged between 45 and 55, and those people get to ride for free? Do you think you would be able to change the code using what you've learned about logical operators, in order to incorporate this addition to our program? Pause the video and give that a go. So we've currently got three conditions:",
      "5 = 2",
      "input()",
      "a = 12"
    ],

It usually contains the latest things I've learnt or discovered. The goal is to keep you inspired and motivated on your journey to becoming a developer. </p><p>I sometimes talk about my struggles as a programmer. I often talk about side projects I'm working on. Most of my friends work in tech, so often I also capture some of my conversations with VCs, founders, CEOs on things like tech stack trends, insider tips and life hacks,</p><p>In addition, the tech world moves very fast and it's difficult to keep on top of all the new developments, tools and skills. So in every edition of the L.A.B. Report, you'll discover 3 things I read in that month. I read a lot, and I try to pick out the top three things I discovered on topics such as Design, Programming, Productivity, Startup Growth and more.</p><p>You can see a&nbsp;sample <a href=\"https://www.appbrewery.com/p/newsletter/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>&nbsp;and decide whether if this is something you would want to receive once a month.&nbsp;</p><p>Because it costs money to send out these emails, if you think this will be useful for you, and <strong><em>only</em></strong> if you <strong>really</strong>&nbsp;want it, then you can sign up over here:</p><p><a href=\"https://londonappbrewery.com/sendy/subscription?f=m7Xj2bDOCQnlJ27yezLEAtJi1mhUIxOaJcJGZYMLLX6wx5MZd0b2FunBI8dOomNt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sign Up Link for Udemy Students</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Best Wishes,</p><p>Your instructor, Angela<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></body></html>"

      "while you're writing your code, it's always a good idea just to make sure that your code is doing what you expect it to do. So in this case, we're going through each of the scores. Now instead of printing it, we want to check it against the number which we want to set as maximum. So similar to sum we need a variable to hold all of the intermediate values until we reach the maximum. So let's create a variable called max_ score and let's just set it to equal 0. Now when we loop through each of the scores, we're going to compare the current score that the loop is going through. So the first time it will be looking at 150. And we're going to say, well, if the score that we're currently looking at, let's say 150 is greater than the max_score, well, in that case, we're going to set the max_score to this current score that we're looking at. And what this loop is going to do is it's going through each of these numbers. So let's go through the first three in order, just so that we can make this process a bit more clear in your mind. The first score is equal to 150. Is 150 greater than 0? Well, yes. So then this bit of code carries out, and now the max score is equal to 150. So for the next score it's 142. So is 142 greater than 150? No. So we're not going to do anything at all. You could, of course, have an else statement that just prints something, but in this case it's unnecessary. We only need to check for one thing, and that one thing is each time we loop through each of the scores, is it greater than the previous maximum? And now if I go ahead and exit the indentation levels and go to the very start. So I'm outside of the for loop and I print out the max score, you'll see that it will give me the same result as using the max function, which is 199. So if this code doesn't make any sense to you, I recommend going back to the previous lesson and revising what we learned about for loops. Alternatively, maybe you need to do some revision on how if statements and conditionals work, but either way, make sure that all of this code makes perfect sense to you, and you can write it from scratch without having to look at the answer code, because it's really, really important. As we progress that, I'm going to assume that all of this makes sense to you so that we can build upon our knowledge. And then once you're ready, I'll see you over in the next lesson. Now, up to this point, we've only been using for loops in association with lists, so we've been looping through the list and getting hold of each of the items in the list and then doing something with it, right? But we're not always going to be working with lists and using for loops. Sometimes we might want to use a loop completely independent of a list. And a good example of this is when Carl Gauss, the German mathematician, was just a child. When he was ten years old, his math teacher gave him an exercise that she probably thought would tie him up for a little while, and the idea was to get him to add all of the numbers from 1 to 100. So 1 + 2 +3 + 4 + 5 et cetera, all the way until 100. And even though she thought this would keep him busy for an hour or so, getting this young child to add up these numbers and I can have some peace and quiet scrolling on Facebook, but unfortunately, he came back to her within two minutes and gave her the answer. So how did he work it out? Well, he is actually a really smart kid, and he figured out that if you flip the numbers around. So 100 plus 99 plus 98, and you look at both of these two lines, you can see that 1 + 100 = 101 , 2 + 99 = 101, 3 + 98 = 101. Basically, if you tie all of these numbers together, there's actually 50 pairs of 101. So he could simply just do 50 multiplied by 101 which is 5050. And that's how he figured out the answer. But we can actually outshine Gauss because we can do this calculation in less than a minute just by writing a few lines of code. But in order to do this, we first have to learn about using for loops with the range function. Now the range function is something that is really, really helpful if you want to generate a range of numbers to loop through. And the syntax looks something like this. So we've still got our for and our in keywords highlighted in blue, but instead of looping through a list, we define how our loop is going to work by creating a range. So in this case I'm creating a range between a and b, and then I'm going to get hold of each number in that range and do something with that number. Now it's important to remember that the range() function doesn't actually do anything by itself. So if we create a range between 1 and 10 and we say, just try to print this and we run, you can see it doesn't actually do anything. It doesn't print out the numbers 1 through to 10 at all. This function has to be used in conjunction with another function, and in our case it's going to be with the for loop. So for example if I wrote, \"for number in range...\" and then my range is going to be (1, 10). So this is going to be the range that I'm going to create between 1 and 10, and then I want to get hold of each of the numbers inside that range. And this is going to be between 1 and 10 and not including ten. So if I go ahead and print out the number that I create from my for loop, then you'll see that what happens is it prints 123456789, but not the last digit, which I've included here. So if I wanted all of the numbers from 1 to 10, I actually have to set a range between 1 and 11. And now when you run the code, you can see that it goes from one all the way up to ten. Now by default the range() function will step through all the numbers from the start to the end, and it will increase by one. Now, if you wanted to increase by any other number, then you have to add another comma to the end of it and specify how large you want the step to be. So let's say we change the step size to 3. Now if I rerun the same code, you'll see that it goes from 1, and then it steps by 3 to 4, and then it steps by 3, and then it steps by 3, finally to 10. Now let's come back to the problem that I mentioned at the beginning of this lesson, How can we add up all of the numbers from 1 to 100 by using code? So I want you to pause the video and see if you can solve the Gauss challenge. Have a go now. All right. So how do we solve this? Well, it's going to involve the for loop, and it's going to involve the range() function because we're going to get hold of every number in the range between 1 and 100. So we need to write 101. Once we've got hold of all of these numbers it's as simple as using an accumulator. So let's say a total = 0. And then inside the for loop. So that means indented, we're going to say total += number. So now it's going to add every number in this range to the total starting from zero. And this is basically going to give us the sum of every number from 1 to 100. So let's go ahead and print it out and see if it matches Gauss's value. And there you have it, 5050. So now that we've beaten Gauss at his own game of math using programming, let's head over to the next lesson and try to complete a challenge using the range() function to see if you managed to internalize and understand everything we talked about in this lesson. So for all of that and more, I'll see you there. Now that we've learned all about loops in Python, we're finally ready to tackle our final project of the day, which is the PyPassword Generator. Our program will ask us, \"How many letters would you like in your password?\" So I will say I would like a long password. Let's say 14. \"How many symbols?\" 3. \"How many numbers?\" 4. And it's going to generate me a password that is almost completely impossible to crack by any hacker, no matter how talented they are. So the project of today is to build this password generator. Then you'll see that here, I've already included for you a list of all the letters in the alphabet, from A to Z, including the uppercase and lowercase letters. I've got a bunch of numbers and a bunch of symbols that are usually accepted by websites in the passwords. Now there's two levels to this project. You can either go for the Easy Version, where all you have to do is generate your password in sequence. So for example, if the user wanted four letters, two symbols and two numbers, then it might just look like this four letters and then two symbols and then two numbers. So they're in sequence, right? First you've got the letters, then you've got the number of required symbols, and then you've got the required numbers. So this is the Easy Level. And then there is the Hard Level. And the Hard Level requires you to generate the password in a completely random order. So instead of having it being letter, symbol, number, it should be maybe letter and then a symbol, and then a number, then a letter, then a symbol and then a number. But notice how this is completely random every single time you generate it, the order of where the symbols and where the numbers appear in your password are completely random. So for example, if you look at the demo version, and I do the same thing 4 letters, 2 symbols, 2 numbers, where the numbers and where the symbols occur are completely unpredictable. So that's the Hard Level. I recommend trying the Easy Level first, and then once you've managed to do it, then take yourself up to the Hard Level. If you think you're up to it, pause the video now and try to complete the final project. All right, so let's first tackle the Easy Level where we're just generating a password with the required number of letters, and then the required number of symbols, and then the required number of numbers. So let's go ahead and tackle this one first. Now we know that we've got these lists which we can draw from, and we know that we can use the Random Module to get hold of a random item from the list. So all we have to do is first get four random letters. So let's say that we had a password which just started out as an empty string, then we can use a for loop to loop through all of the characters that we need to create for our password. For example, I might say for char, short for character, in the range of...from 1 to the number of letters that the user wanted. So in this case, if the user wanted 4 letters, then it will be a range from 1 to 4, but not including 4. So it's actually from 1 to 3, which is only three characters. In order to modify this, we have to do what we did always before, which is just to add one to the end of our range. So now we're going to create a range based on the number of letters that the user wanted. And I'm just going to go along with the assumption that the number of letters equals 4. Let's just pretend that's what the user will enter. So then this range becomes 1 - 4 + 1 which is 5. So the range is in fact going to be 1 - 4. For every single number in that range from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4, I'm going to generate them a random letter. And I'm going to pick it out of this list of letters. To do that I can either generate a random number and use it as the index, or you might have seen previously, I showed you the random.choice() function. And inside this random.choice(), we can pass a sequence which in our case is the letters list. Then it will look through this list of letters and it will give us a random item from that list. So now that random letter is going to be something that we're going to need to add to our password, right? So we can set this equal to a random character (random.char). And now let's go ahead and just print it out. So let's say we want 4 letters in our password, and we can type anything for the other ones. But notice how when the for loop runs, it's given us some random characters that it's picked out of our letters list. How can we add each of those letters to our password? Well, we can use the string concatenation that we learned very early on in Day 1. We can say the password equals the previous password plus the random_char Of course, the shortened version of this is just password += random_char. And now let's go ahead, and instead of printing the random_char, let's print the password at each stage of the loop. And again I'm going to choose 4 letters. So you can see the first time the for loop runs I get a capital H as the random_char, and then the next time the loop runs, I get an A and the A is tagged to the end of the H. So I get HA, and so on and so forth until I get these four characters in the beginning of what seems to be my random password that's going to be generated. Now, if you wanted to, you can actually simplify this down to just one step, because instead of having this intermediary, which is the random_char variable, we can simply just replace it with the code like this. So in this case, we're getting a random choice from our letters list, so we get a random letter, and then we add that to our password. Now that we've done that for the letter, then it's pretty easy to see how we can continue doing this for the symbol and the numbers. We just have to keep adding it to the end of our password. So let me quickly write out the code for this. So now when the user requests that they want four letters in their password, then we generate a range from 1 to 5. And then for each of those positions, we generate a random letter in order to fill the password. And then we add on the required number of symbols and the required number of numbers. And finally we print out the final password. Now there's a way to simplify our code even more. Previously, we always used the range by starting from one and then going up to one over the number that we want. For example, when we wanted 1 to 100, we created a range of 1 to 101. Now in this case, because all that we want is a range that covers all the letters, symbols, and numbers that the user wants. So if the user wanted four letters, then what we need the range to be is 1, 2, 3, and 4, which in this case is a range of (1, 5), because of the way that the range doesn't include the upper limit. Now, if we think about this logically, we can also change this to 0, 1, 2, 3 So then we can have a range of 0 to 4. So that means we can actually use the number of letters as the upper limit, and then simply change this to 0 so that we don't have to add 1 to our number of letters. And I think this will make our code even simpler and hopefully simpler to understand as well. Now, if you prefer the previous version, which we've seen throughout the course, then feel free to keep it as it is. But this way we get rid of all of these plus ones and you can see it's a lot tidier. Let's go ahead and run this code. And again I'm going to choose 4 letters, 2 numbers, and 2 symbols. And I end up with my final password which fits exactly that criteria, and it looks pretty random. But the only problem is that if a hacker knew that you always have two symbols at this position and two numbers at this position, then it's very easy to crack that password, because in order to get the last digit, for example, they only have to try nine different variations 123456789 . And this just limits the strength of your password. In order to tackle that, you would have to tackle it at the Hard Level, which is how do you get a password that has all of these letters and numbers in a completely random order. To do that, we mentioned that you have to do a bit of Googling because it might require something that you haven't done before, but in essence, you've got access to everything you need to perform the logic. So if you haven't given that a go, then this might be a good time to pause and have a think about how you might structure the logic, or how you might create a flow chart to express this logic that you would want. And once you've done that, and if you want to see the solution and walk through it with me, then come back here, and I'll show you how to do it, but first give it a go. All right. In order to tackle the Hard Level, what we essentially need to do is instead of adding each of these letters into a string, we actually want to add it into a list. So I'm going to copy all of this that's here, and I'm just going to comment it out, and I'm going to paste it under my Hard Level and work on it here. So instead of using a password string I'm going to create a list and to better describe it. I'll change my variable name to Password list. So now instead of using password to add each of these letters and numbers and symbols, I'm going to be adding it to my list. Now, to add things to a list, you can use the same syntax that you did with strings, which is to add the new item into the list and to update the old list. You might be more familiar though with the syntax, which is append(), and both of these work. You can use either of them if you want, but they'll end up doing the same thing, which is to add each of those things you've generated in the order that you've generated to your password. So we end up now with a list with four letters, two symbols, and two numbers, all stored as strings because of the quotation marks around them. So now that we've got a list, well, then we have to think about, well, how can we shuffle our list? How can we mess up the order of the items in our list? And that might take you to Google, and you might search for something like how to change the order of items in a list. And then we also have to add our keyword, which is Python, because there's obviously a lot of other programming languages. And we come up against our first StackOverflow question, how can I reorder a list? Well, that sounds kind of like what I want to do, right? So if we scroll down, you can see that the way to do it is either using a for loop like so, or to simply use the shuffle() function. This is a much simpler way, because it allows us to update the existing list just by calling the shuffle() function on it, and this one actually requires us to create a new list, and we have to create a bunch of random numbers for the order and then to reorder them using a for loop. So I'm going to go with this version and let's try it out. Let's print the password list before the shuffle. And then let's use the random.shuffle and pass in the password_list. And then let's print the outcome of that shuffle. So let's print the password_list again. So now you can see that we've got a version before. And then we've got a version after. So if I run my code and I write again 4 letters, 2 symbols, 2 numbers, you can see that previously it was ordered in the order that we added each of the characters, after the shuffle, they're now pretty much random. There's letters in random places, there's are symbols in random places, So if only we could turn this back into a string. Then we've got our password that's nicely shuffled. So how can we turn it back into a string? Well, we could simply use a for loop, right? We could say, \"for each char in the password_list...\"we're going to add it to a variable called password, which is going to start off again as a empty string. And then we're going to add to it. So we're going to say password  += each character in our password_list. And now if I go ahead and just print my final password I'm going to add an f-string as well. Let's say,  \"Your password is:",
      "99 = 101",
      "if they work. So how do you know if your email and password is on a database somewhere? You can head over to haveibeenpwned.com. Notice the spelling there, and type in your email to see if it was involved in a website that had been hacked. So let's try an email here elon@tesla.com and it tells us, Oh no, it seems like this email has been pawned. And these were the websites which got hacked, potentially leaking this email and its associated password. I actually recommend you to try out your own email addresses right now and see which services you signed up to have been compromised, but if you want better security, then you'll actually need unique passwords for each and every website. And they should really be strong passwords, not 123456, or qwerty. If I just called out your password, please change it. Now, what we're going to be building is exactly that. We're going to be building a Password Generator, something that's going to generate strong passwords with letters, and symbols, and numbers. Firstly, it asks us how many letters would you like in your password? I would like 12. How many symbols would you like? I would like 2. And I would also like 2 numbers in my password. And then I hit Enter, and it gives me the password that it has generated with two symbols, two numbers, and 12 letters. So that's a pretty strong looking password, if you ask me. Now I can use this and update my password to something very strong and very secure. So this is what we'll be building by the end of today, but in order to do it, we first need to learn some new skills and new concepts. So head over to the next lesson and let's get started. The first topic I want to talk about today is the concept of Loops. Things that have to happen over and over and over again. The first type of loop I want to introduce you to is something called the for loop, and it can be used really easily in combination with something we learned in yesterday's lessons, which is Lists. By using a for loop like this, we can go through each item in a list and perform some action with each individual item. So let's try it out in practice. First, let's say we had a list called fruits and it contained three items apple, peach, and pear. If we wanted to access each item in this list individually and print it out one by one, then we would use a for loop. So we start out with the keyword \"for\" and then we give a name to a single item, so in this case we might call it, fruit. And then we use the \"in\" keyword. And finally, the list that we want to loop through, which is our fruits here. Now we cap it off with a colon, and we go on to the next line and notice how it's indented there. Now I'm going to go ahead and print the value of each of the fruit variables. And if I run this code you'll see that it loops through my list of fruits, and for each of the fruits inside the list, it prints it out into the console. Apple, Peach, Pear in that order. Now, the important thing to realize here is that basically, you can imagine that behind the scenes, what this code is doing is it's taking this list of fruits and it's assigning a variable name fruit to each of them. So the first time this runs fruit is equal to Apple. The second time this runs fruit is equal to Peach. And we can see this even more clearly if you run it through the Thonny IDE which I told you about at the beginning of the course. Now, if I go ahead and click on the debug icon and I step into each of the steps, you can see, first, it establishes that we have a list of three strings Apple, Peach, Pear. And then we go into the for loop. Now notice on the right here I've got all the variables being accounted for. And the first one it's noticed is the variable fruits which holds a list of strings. Now as I continue into the for loop, notice how it's going to look through this list of fruits. And it's going to assign the variable name fruit to each of the items starting from the first one, Apple. So now by the time it's reached line three, we've already got this variable called fruit that's been assigned to the value of Apple. And so at this point printing out the value of this fruit, it's obviously going to print out Apple as you'll see in the next step. There we go. Now, once I'm done here, then it's going to loop back to the start of the for loop, and now this variable fruit is going to be assigned to the next value inside the list of fruits. So now notice how the variable fruit is attached to the value Peach. And then it continues this and so on and so forth until it prints out each one of the fruits. And this really emphasizes the most important aspect of loops. The loop allows us to execute the same line of code multiple times. In this case we're executing the print statement three times. But our for loop isn't limited to just executing a single statement. We don't just have to print out the name of an item in the list. We can execute a whole block of statements multiple times, and we can do many things inside this for loop, and by inside I mean indented. So let's say that in addition to printing out the fruit, I'm going to write another print statement, and I'm going to not only print out the name of the fruit, but I'm also going to say fruit + space plus pie. So when I run this code, what do you think will happen? Well, it prints out Apple, and then it prints out Apple Plus pie. And then it goes back to the start and it assigns the variable fruit to the next item. Peach. Peach pie. Pear. Pear pie. So this is how we can implement a simple for loop that loops through a list and assigns a variable name to each of the items in the list in order, and then inside the for loop after the colon, after some indentation, we can do something with that temporary variable for each of the items. Now, I've been talking a lot about the concept of being inside a for loop versus being outside a for loop, and this is really, really important. Whenever you see a colon, say in our if statements that we saw previously, or the for loop that we're using here, the indentation is really, really important because if it's indented then it means that it's inside the for loop and these instructions will get carried out for as many times as the for loop will need to repeat. Now, if I decided that I wanted to say print my fruits, so my list of fruits up here, and I put it inside my for loop, so indented after the for loop. Then, as you can imagine, it's going to print that for as many times as the loop runs, which is going to be three because there's three items in our list. Now, if I had indented that back to the beginning, so now it's no longer inside the for loop, then it's only going to print once and it's going to print it after the for loop is done. So notice how it's doing the whole Apple Apple pie, etc. and then once the loop is finished, then it jumps to the next line and carries out this instruction. So the indentation is really, really important, and you have to be really careful with this. Have a play around with this code. And if you're still struggling to see how it works, then move the code over to Thonny and step through each step, one at a time and see how it works. But I hope you're starting to see how loops are really handy at executing an instruction over and over and over again, getting the computer to save us time and energy. A really good example of when loops would come in really handy is, you know, how Bart Simpson gets punished and has to write out a sentence over and over again on the blackboard? Well, if only Bart was a programmer, then he would be able to use loops to do this and he would be able to chill in the corner. Now, once you're happy with this type of for loop, then head over to the next lesson where I've got a coding exercise that's going to put your knowledge to the test. All right, so I'll see you there. Now, one of the things that you'll start to realize about the Python programming language, especially if you have experience of other programming languages, is that Python is extremely number friendly. It has a lot of built in functions to help us work with numbers. For example, if I had a class of students and I list each of their exam scores inside this giant list, and I wanted to work out, well, what is the total exam score. So what if I added each of these numbers up together, what would I get? Well, Python has something called the sum(), which allows us to put in any iterable data type, including lists. So I can put the student scores into here. And I can set this, let's say, to the total_exam_score. And then if I print this, you'll see that it has added up each of those numbers in the list, and it equals 2068. Now if I wanted to do this manually though, I could because at the end of the day, all that's happened is the Python team, when they developed the programming language they created each of these helpful functions so we could create some ourselves as well, given that we understand how for loops work. So we could say for score in student_scores, colon. And then in the indented block we could say, well, we need to add each of these scores to each other, right? And then we need some sort of variable to keep hold of it. So let's create a variable called sum and set it to start off as equal to 0. And then we could say, sum += score. And every time this for loop runs it's going to go to the next score and the next score, and each time that score is added to the previous value of sum, so then it accumulates in that variable. So now what we can do is go ahead and print the sum and go ahead and hit Run. And you can see that it's exactly the same number as before. So this is a way that we can use the primitive parts of Python. So the building blocks of Python, to build out functionality for various use cases, such as summarizing each of the numbers in a list and adding them together. So here is your challenge. You're going to do the same, but in your case you're going to try and replicate the max functionality. So this is a built-in function that allows us to pass in a list, for example, student_scores, and if we print it, you can see it will pick out the largest number in this list, which happens to be 199. Now your job is to replicate this functionality, but using what you have learned about for loops, about Lists, about Conditionals, and see if you can figure out how to achieve this. So pause the video now and give this challenge a go. So similar to previously, we will use a for loop to loop through each of the scores in the list of student_scores. and if you want to verify it as you go along while you're writing your code, it's always a good idea just to make sure that your code is doing what you expect it to do. So in this case, we're going through each of the scores. Now instead of printing it, we want to check it against the number which we want to set as maximum. So similar to sum we need a variable to hold all of the intermediate values until we reach the maximum. So let's create a variable called max_ score and let's just set it to equal 0. Now when we loop through each of the scores, we're going to compare the current score that the loop is going through. So the first time it will be looking at 150. And we're going to say, well, if the score that we're currently looking at, let's say 150 is greater than the max_score, well, in that case, we're going to set the max_score to this current score that we're looking at. And what this loop is going to do is it's going through each of these numbers. So let's go through the first three in order, just so that we can make this process a bit more clear in your mind. The first score is equal to 150. Is 150 greater than 0? Well, yes. So then this bit of code carries out, and now the max score is equal to 150. So for the next score it's 142. So is 142 greater than 150? No. So we're not going to do anything at all. You could, of course, have an else statement that just prints something, but in this case it's unnecessary. We only need to check for one thing, and that one thing is each time we loop through each of the scores, is it greater than the previous maximum? And now if I go ahead and exit the indentation levels and go to the very start. So I'm outside of the for loop and I print out the max score, you'll see that it will give me the same result as using the max function, which is 199. So if this code doesn't make any sense to you, I recommend going back to the previous lesson and revising what we learned about for loops. Alternatively, maybe you need to do some revision on how if statements and conditionals work, but either way, make sure that all of this code makes perfect sense to you, and you can write it from scratch without having to look at the answer code, because it's really, really important. As we progress that, I'm going to assume that all of this makes sense to you so that we can build upon our knowledge. And then once you're ready, I'll see you over in the next lesson. Now, up to this point, we've only been using for loops in association with lists, so we've been looping through the list and getting hold of each of the items in the list and then doing something with it, right? But we're not always going to be working with lists and using for loops. Sometimes we might want to use a loop completely independent of a list. And a good example of this is when Carl Gauss, the German mathematician, was just a child. When he was ten years old, his math teacher gave him an exercise that she probably thought would tie him up for a little while, and the idea was to get him to add all of the numbers from 1 to 100. So 1 + 2 +3 + 4 + 5 et cetera, all the way until 100. And even though she thought this would keep him busy for an hour or so, getting this young child to add up these numbers and I can have some peace and quiet scrolling on Facebook, but unfortunately, he came back to her within two minutes and gave her the answer. So how did he work it out? Well, he is actually a really smart kid, and he figured out that if you flip the numbers around. So 100 plus 99 plus 98, and you look at both of these two lines, you can see that 1 + 100 = 101 , 2 + 99 = 101, 3 + 98 = 101. Basically, if you tie all of these numbers together, there's actually 50 pairs of 101. So he could simply just do 50 multiplied by 101 which is 5050. And that's how he figured out the answer. But we can actually outshine Gauss because we can do this calculation in less than a minute just by writing a few lines of code. But in order to do this, we first have to learn about using for loops with the range function. Now the range function is something that is really, really helpful if you want to generate a range of numbers to loop through. And the syntax looks something like this. So we've still got our for and our in keywords highlighted in blue, but instead of looping through a list, we define how our loop is going to work by creating a range. So in this case I'm creating a range between a and b, and then I'm going to get hold of each number in that range and do something with that number. Now it's important to remember that the range() function doesn't actually do anything by itself. So if we create a range between 1 and 10 and we say, just try to print this and we run, you can see it doesn't actually do anything. It doesn't print out the numbers 1 through to 10 at all. This function has to be used in conjunction with another function, and in our case it's going to be with the for loop. So for example if I wrote, \"for number in range...\" and then my range is going to be (1, 10). So this is going to be the range that I'm going to create between 1 and 10, and then I want to get hold of each of the numbers inside that range. And this is going to be between 1 and 10 and not including ten. So if I go ahead and print out the number that I create from my for loop, then you'll see that what happens is it prints 123456789, but not the last digit, which I've included here. So if I wanted all of the numbers from 1 to 10, I actually have to set a range between 1 and 11. And now when you run the code, you can see that it goes from one all the way up to ten. Now by default the range() function will step through all the numbers from the start to the end, and it will increase by one. Now, if you wanted to increase by any other number, then you have to add another comma to the end of it and specify how large you want the step to be. So let's say we change the step size to 3. Now if I rerun the same code, you'll see that it goes from 1, and then it steps by 3 to 4, and then it steps by 3, and then it steps by 3, finally to 10. Now let's come back to the problem that I mentioned at the beginning of this lesson, How can we add up all of the numbers from 1 to 100 by using code? So I want you to pause the video and see if you can solve the Gauss challenge. Have a go now. All right. So how do we solve this? Well, it's going to involve the for loop, and it's going to involve the range() function because we're going to get hold of every number in the range between 1 and 100. So we need to write 101. Once we've got hold of all of these numbers it's as simple as using an accumulator. So let's say a total = 0. And then inside the for loop. So that means indented, we're going to say total += number. So now it's going to add every number in this range to the total starting from zero. And this is basically going to give us the sum of every number from 1 to 100. So let's go ahead and print it out and see if it matches Gauss's value. And there you have it, 5050. So now that we've beaten Gauss at his own game of math using programming, let's head over to the next lesson and try to complete a challenge using the range() function to see if you managed to internalize and understand everything we talked about in this lesson. So for all of that and more, I'll see you there. Now that we've learned all about loops in Python, we're finally ready to tackle our final project of the day, which is the PyPassword Generator. Our program will ask us, \"How many letters would you like in your password?\" So I will say I would like a long password. Let's say 14. \"How many symbols?\" 3. \"How many numbers?\" 4. And it's going to generate me a password that is almost completely impossible to crack by any hacker, no matter how talented they are. So the project of today is to build this password generator. Then you'll see that here, I've already included for you a list of all the letters in the alphabet, from A to Z, including the uppercase and lowercase letters. I've got a bunch of numbers and a bunch of symbols that are usually accepted by websites in the passwords. Now there's two levels to this project. You can either go for the Easy Version, where all you have to do is generate your password in sequence. So for example, if the user wanted four letters, two symbols and two numbers, then it might just look like this four letters and then two symbols and then two numbers. So they're in sequence, right? First you've got the letters, then you've got the number of required symbols, and then you've got the required numbers. So this is the Easy Level. And then there is the Hard Level. And the Hard Level requires you to generate the password in a completely random order. So instead of having it being letter, symbol, number, it should be maybe letter and then a symbol, and then a number, then a letter, then a symbol and then a number. But notice how this is completely random every single time you generate it, the order of where the symbols and where the numbers appear in your password are completely random. So for example, if you look at the demo version, and I do the same thing 4 letters, 2 symbols, 2 numbers, where the numbers and where the symbols occur are completely unpredictable. So that's the Hard Level. I recommend trying the Easy Level first, and then once you've managed to do it, then take yourself up to the Hard Level. If you think you're up to it, pause the video now and try to complete the final project. All right, so let's first tackle the Easy Level where we're just generating a password with the required number of letters, and then the required number of symbols, and then the required number of numbers. So let's go ahead and tackle this one first. Now we know that we've got these lists which we can draw from, and we know that we can use the Random Module to get hold of a random item from the list. So all we have to do is first get four random letters. So let's say that we had a password which just started out as an empty string, then we can use a for loop to loop through all of the characters that we need to create for our password. For example, I might say for char, short for character, in the range of...from 1 to the number of letters that the user wanted. So in this case, if the user wanted 4 letters, then it will be a range from 1 to 4, but not including 4. So it's actually from 1 to 3, which is only three characters. In order to modify this, we have to do what we did always before, which is just to add one to the end of our range. So now we're going to create a range based on the number of letters that the user wanted. And I'm just going to go along with the assumption that the number of letters equals 4. Let's just pretend that's what the user will enter. So then this range becomes 1 - 4 + 1 which is 5. So the range is in fact going to be 1 - 4. For every single number in that range from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4, I'm going to generate them a random letter. And I'm going to pick it out of this list of letters. To do that I can either generate a random number and use it as the index, or you might have seen previously, I showed you the random.choice() function. And inside this random.choice(), we can pass a sequence which in our case is the letters list. Then it will look through this list of letters and it will give us a random item from that list. So now that random letter is going to be something that we're going to need to add to our password, right? So we can set this equal to a random character (random.char). And now let's go ahead and just print it out. So let's say we want 4 letters in our password, and we can type anything for the other ones. But notice how when the for loop runs, it's given us some random characters that it's picked out of our letters list. How can we add each of those letters to our password? Well, we can use the string concatenation that we learned very early on in Day 1. We can say the password equals the previous password plus the random_char Of course, the shortened version of this is just password += random_char. And now let's go ahead, and instead of printing the random_char, let's print the password at each stage of the loop. And again I'm going to choose 4 letters. So you can see the first time the for loop runs I get a capital H as the random_char, and then the next time the loop runs, I get an A and the A is tagged to the end of the H. So I get HA, and so on and so forth until I get these four characters in the beginning of what seems to be my random password that's going to be generated. Now, if you wanted to, you can actually simplify this down to just one step, because instead of having this intermediary, which is the random_char variable, we can simply just replace it with the code like this. So in this case, we're getting a random choice from our letters list, so we get a random letter, and then we add that to our password. Now that we've done that for the letter, then it's pretty easy to see how we can continue doing this for the symbol and the numbers. We just have to keep adding it to the end of our password. So let me quickly write out the code for this. So now when the user requests that they want four letters in their password, then we generate a range from 1 to 5. And then for each of those positions, we generate a random letter in order to fill the password. And then we add on the required number of symbols and the required number of numbers. And finally we print out the final password. Now there's a way to simplify our code even more. Previously, we always used the range by starting from one and then going up to one over the number that we want. For example, when we wanted 1 to 100, we created a range of 1 to 101. Now in this case, because all that we want is a range that covers all the letters, symbols, and numbers that the user wants. So if the user wanted four letters, then what we need the range to be is 1, 2, 3, and 4, which in this case is a range of (1, 5), because of the way that the range doesn't include the upper limit. Now, if we think about this logically, we can also change this to 0, 1, 2, 3 So then we can have a range of 0 to 4. So that means we can actually use the number of letters as the upper limit, and then simply change this to 0 so that we don't have to add 1 to our number of letters. And I think this will make our code even simpler and hopefully simpler to understand as well. Now, if you prefer the previous version, which we've seen throughout the course, then feel free to keep it as it is. But this way we get rid of all of these plus ones and you can see it's a lot tidier. Let's go ahead and run this code. And again I'm going to choose 4 letters, 2 numbers, and 2 symbols. And I end up with my final password which fits exactly that criteria, and it looks pretty random. But the only problem is that if a hacker knew that you always have two symbols at this position and two numbers at this position, then it's very easy to crack that password, because in order to get the last digit, for example, they only have to try nine different variations 123456789 . And this just limits the strength of your password. In order to tackle that, you would have to tackle it at the Hard Level, which is how do you get a password that has all of these letters and numbers in a completely random order. To do that, we mentioned that you have to do a bit of Googling because it might require something that you haven't done before, but in essence, you've got access to everything you need to perform the logic. So if you haven't given that a go, then this might be a good time to pause and have a think about how you might structure the logic, or how you might create a flow chart to express this logic that you would want. And once you've done that, and if you want to see the solution and walk through it with me, then come back here, and I'll show you how to do it, but first give it a go. All right. In order to tackle the Hard Level, what we essentially need to do is instead of adding each of these letters into a string, we actually want to add it into a list. So I'm going to copy all of this that's here, and I'm just going to comment it out, and I'm going to paste it under my Hard Level and work on it here. So instead of using a password string I'm going to create a list and to better describe it. I'll change my variable name to Password list. So now instead of using password to add each of these letters and numbers and symbols, I'm going to be adding it to my list. Now, to add things to a list, you can use the same syntax that you did with strings, which is to add the new item into the list and to update the old list. You might be more familiar though with the syntax, which is append(), and both of these work. You can use either of them if you want, but they'll end up doing the same thing, which is to add each of those things you've generated in the order that you've generated to your password. So we end up now with a list with four letters, two symbols, and two numbers, all stored as strings because of the quotation marks around them. So now that we've got a list, well, then we have to think about, well, how can we shuffle our list? How can we mess up the order of the items in our list? And that might take you to Google, and you might search for something like how to change the order of items in a list. And then we also have to add our keyword, which is Python, because there's obviously a lot of other programming languages. And we come up against our first StackOverflow question, how can I reorder a list? Well, that sounds kind of like what I want to do, right? So if we scroll down, you can see that the way to do it is either using a for loop like so, or to simply use the shuffle() function. This is a much simpler way, because it allows us to update the existing list just by calling the shuffle() function on it, and this one actually requires us to create a new list, and we have to create a bunch of random numbers for the order and then to reorder them using a for loop. So I'm going to go with this version and let's try it out. Let's print the password list before the shuffle. And then let's use the random.shuffle and pass in the password_list. And then let's print the outcome of that shuffle. So let's print the password_list again. So now you can see that we've got a version before. And then we've got a version after. So if I run my code and I write again 4 letters, 2 symbols, 2 numbers, you can see that previously it was ordered in the order that we added each of the characters, after the shuffle, they're now pretty much random. There's letters in random places, there's are symbols in random places, So if only we could turn this back into a string. Then we've got our password that's nicely shuffled. So how can we turn it back into a string? Well, we could simply use a for loop, right? We could say, \"for each char in the password_list...\"we're going to add it to a variable called password, which is going to start off again as a empty string. And then we're going to add to it. So we're going to say password  += each character in our password_list. And now if I go ahead and just print my final password I'm going to add an f-string as well. Let's say,  \"Your password is:"

      "if you head over to the next lesson, let's get started and let's start learning about some of these things. Right, Right. Hey, well done for completing day six. Now I remember back  when I was learning how to wind surf, just how hard learning a new skill can be. And I think when you become an adult, this is like a really unfamiliar sensation, learning something new. Because more often than not, you're probably working in a job that you've done for years. You've probably gotten really good at it and you haven't actually needed to struggle to really feel the pain that you feel with learning. And this might be the first time you're doing that for a while. So just as when you get onto a wind surf board and you hit the water a few times really painfully, I just hit my face so many times that, um, you feel like this is too hard, but actually the struggle is necessary. The more you struggle, the more you're learning. So don't interpret the struggle as a bad thing. It's a good thing. It means that you're making progress. So keep going and I'll keep practicing my hat tricks, Right? The first concept I want to introduce you to is something called functions. And just as we perform many different functions could be mother, father, son, daughter, we can also get our code to perform different pieces of functionality. Now if we think back we've actually already come across functions, and I've been referring to them every time we've needed to use one. If you take a look at this link in the course resources, which takes you to the Python documentation, then you can see that Python has a whole bunch of built in functions that we've been using. For example, the len() function, which gives us the number of items in a collection, or the int() function, which turns something into an integer, or the print() function, the range() function, and other ones that we haven't seen yet. We can start typing one of the functions that we've been using a lot, which is the print function. And the reason why we know it's a function is because it's the name of a function followed by a set of parentheses. Now we know that if we put something inside these parentheses say for example (\"Hello\"), then when I run the code, whatever is inside those parentheses will get outputted over here in the console. Now all the functions work pretty much the same. So if I wanted to use the len() function to see, well, how many characters are there in this word \"Hello\", I again put my hello inside the parentheses and because of the parentheses, we know that this is a function. And then I can save the outcome of this length function to a variable. Say let's call it number of characters, num_char. And then I can go ahead and print it in order to view it inside the console. So let's print the num_char, and now you can see that this len() function gets to work, calculates the number of characters, it's 5, and then it gets printed. So all of this functionality has been achieved by these built-in functions from Python like print() and len(). Now what if we wanted to make our own functions? How would we do that? Well, if we want to make our own function, we first start out with a keyword which is called, def, and this is because we're creating or defining our function. Now after the def keyword we can give our function a name. And I'm just going to call it my_function. Now the thing that differentiates a function from a variable however, is the parentheses. So after the name comes the parentheses. And now the final thing, the finishing touch to our function definition is a colon because that says everything that comes after that line and is indented belongs with the function. Let's make a really simple function that just has two lines of code. Maybe It prints \"Hello\", and then it prints. \"Bye\". So now I've created my_function. I've placed the lines of code that are associated with this function, all indented after the definition, but notice how if I go ahead and run my code, actually nothing will happen. And the reason is because we haven't yet executed the function. Now we can define lots and lots of functions ahead of time, and it's only when we actually need it do we go ahead and trigger it. And to trigger it, or in programming lingo, we would say to call the function, all we have to do is type the name of the function, which is my_function, and then to add the parentheses and any necessary inputs. In our case, our function doesn't require any inputs, so we can leave the parentheses blank again. And now if I go ahead and run my code once more, then you'll see that by the time the computer reaches Line 5, it's going to search for this thing called my function. It sees that it was defined right here on Line 1, and it goes through all of the content and executes them in turn, line by line. And that's why we get, Hello and Bye being printed here. So just to recap, this is how we create a function in Python. There's two steps to it. The first step is to actually define the function to specify what it should do, and we do that by first using the def keyword. And then we give our function a name, so for example in this case I called it my_function. And then comes a set of parentheses and a colon. And then after that we get to put the lines of code which will be included in this function. And remember that these lines of code which goes into the function which will be carried out when this function is triggered, must be indented, like this. So once you've defined the function, you've created the recipe, the next step is to actually use it, which in programming lingo we would say calling the function. And we call the function just by specifying the name and a set of parentheses. And once the computer sees this line of code, it'll know to go and carry out all the instructions inside where we defined our function. And to learn about functions, I'm going to introduce you to something that's very similar to Karel the Robot. The robot is going to be something that is just going to perform the tasks that we want it to, and no more and no less. So, for example, if we wanted a robot to go to the store and pick up some milk for us, we can't simply just tell it, \"Oh yeah, just go and buy some milk,\" because it won't know how to do that unless we give it specific instructions such as leave the house, walk two blocks to the right, walk four blocks back, and then two blocks to the right. When you go to the store, give them some money and then take the milk and come back. We have to program each and every step. But say if this functionality of getting the robot to go and pick up some milk for us is needed every single day, then we have to write out all of those instructions day after day, day after day. And at some point our fingers are gonna hurt, right? We're typing so much code that's repeated because we don't have a way of bundling all those instructions together. And that's where functions come in. Functions will give us a way of referring to all those instructions at the same time. That way we can give our robot a single instruction, and it will carry out all of those little steps for us and get us some milk. Now to try this out yourself, I want you to head over to the Course Resources and click on the link that takes you to Reeborg's World. Now Reeborg's World is very similar to Karel the Robot that I showed you earlier on, but it allows us to write Python code and it's very easy to get started. Now we've got this area here which we're going to use to write our Python code, and then once we're done, we can click on play to run the Python code and see the instructions carried out by our Robot. Now if you click on Reebok's keyboard, you can see all of the functions that we can use to command our robot like move() or turn_left(), or build_wall, etc.. Let's see if we go ahead and run this line of code here, move(), what happens? When I click Play\u25b6\ufe0f, you can see that our robot moves forward in the direction that it's facing by one step. So if we wanted it to move say for example three steps, all we have to do is to call the move() function three times. Now let's reset by clicking the Return button to return our robot back to the starting position. Now let's click Play again in order for our robot to carry out the new instructions. Notice how all the instructions were carried out very quickly. To execute each instruction, one step at a time, line by line, we can use this step-through button \u23ef\ufe0f. This button allows us to see how each instruction is executed and after each instruction, it pauses and highlights the next instruction. This is very helpful for debugging. So notice how we're highlighting Line 2. So if I click on step again it's going to carry out that function, and then it's going to carry out Line 3, and finally it reaches the end. And that's the end of our code. Now, in addition, we can use some of the other commands in the keyboard, for example, turn_left(). If I decide to say move() three times, and then turn_left(), and then maybe move() three times again, can you predict which square the robot is going to end up in? Are you ready? Let's go ahead and run the code. There we go. We end up on the square 4, 4. It moves() three forwards, turns_left(), and then moves() three steps again, because that's what we told it to do with our Python code. So now here's a question, if you take a look inside this set of commands, you'll notice that there is move(), and there is turn_left(), but there is no turn_right(), and there is no turn_around. So how could we use a function to create those commands? Because of course, we could just simply write turn_left(), and then turn_left() again. And this would effectively turn the robot around, right? But if we wanted to do that many times, say for example, if we wanted to go to 3, turn around, go back to 1, turn around, go back to 3, then we would have to write code that looks a bit like this. We would have to say move() two times to get to square 3, turn_left(), turn_left(), and then move two times again to get to 1 and then turn_left(), turn_left() again in order to turn around. This is all the code we would have to write to achieve this kind of effect. But instead of all of this, we could just define a new function. So we use the def keyword to say that this code is defining a new function called turn-around(). And this function is simply going to be turn_left() twice. And remember all the code that's going to go inside the function has to be indented. And now instead of writing turn_left(), turn_left(), we can simplify our code by telling it to call the function turn_around(). And we can do that here. And we can do that here. So now when we run the code you'll see that it does exactly the same thing as before. But this time we've cut down two lines of code. So instead of eight lines of code for our instructions, we only now need six lines. And you can see that the more that you need to use this function, the more typing it will save you. But more important than reducing the number of lines of code is that our code has also become a lot more readable, so the turn_around() function is much more clear than having turn_left() twice. Now let's see what happens when we use the step through button. Look closely at how each line in our code is executed. So now we're going to carry out the move() by one, move() by one. And now it's going to call turn_around(), that function. And it jumps over to find this function and carries out the code inside in turn, from the top to the bottom. So turn_left(), turn_left(). And now once that function is done, it goes back to where it was before and continues running, move(), move(), and then turn_around() again. So here's your challenge, try and create a separate function that turns our robot to the right. Pause the video, head over to the Course Resources and click on the link that takes you to Reeborg's World. And then go ahead and create your own function called turn_right(). All right, so this should be pretty simple because all we have to do is to define a new function called turn_right(). And this function is going to simply be turn_left() three times. Because turning left three times is going to effectively turn our robot, right. So even though we only have this one way of turning our robot, we can define our own functions to give it many, many other commands that it could use. So now using this turn_right function(), see if you can write some code that makes our robot draw a little square going from here to here, then to here and back to the beginning. Once you're done and you hit play, this is what should happen. So pause the video now and see if you can complete that challenge. All right so let's go from the beginning. We start out facing right at the position 1, 1. In order to draw the square starting from this way we have to first turn_left(), and then we have to move() one step. And that should take us to here. And now we have to turn_right(), move() one more step, turn_right() again, move() one more step, and finally turn_right() for the last time and move() one more step. So using our awesome function means that we don't have to write out turn_left() three times, each time we need to turn_right(). So our code can just be eight lines long instead of 14 lines long. And we're using our function to cut down on a lot of typing. But not only are there fewer lines of code, look at how much more readable our code has become thanks to our turn_right() function. It's now so much easier to read, turn_right(), and understand what it needs to do rather than seeing turn_left() three times in the code. So now it's easier to read and it's easier to follow the logic in our code. In the next lesson, I've got a challenge for you. Head over there and apply what you've learned about functions to try and solve it. I'll see you there. All right. So now that you've learned about functions, I have a coding challenge for you. If you head over to this link, which is in the course resources and head over to this challenge which is called Hurdle 1, the idea is that we've got a robot here which needs to do a number of hurdles to jump over each of these barriers, to get to the final goal here. Now you need to use your knowledge of functions as well as some of the things you've learned before, such as the for loop or the range function, to be able to achieve this. Now, remember that you can tell the robot to move by typing, move(), and when that's run, it will move by one space. And you can also use, say, turn_left to get the robot to turn left. And in this case, when I run the code, it's going to move one space and face to the left. In order to complete this entire challenge, you can see there's a number of steps that the robot has to go through before it can get to this final goal. And if you were to write out each of these steps, like I have done here one after the other, it would take many, many tens of lines of code. And that's not what we're about. We're programmers. So we're born to be lazy. Try and see if you can minimize number lines of code while still keeping your code readable and understandable by somebody else and be able to get your robot to complete these instructions and take the robot to the final goalpost. And once you've completed the challenge successfully, you should get a green popup that says you're at the correct X and Y position. So pause the video now, head over to this link and give this challenge a go. Right. All right. So how did you get on with this challenge? How many lines of code did it take you to tell this robot to get to the goal? All right. Let's have a think about how we might tackle this. We know that out of the things that we can tell the robot to do, the most useful things are to move and to turn left. But because the robot doesn't have a builtin turn right function, then we have to define that ourselves. And the reason why we need to do that is because you can see that at several points during the hurdle, we'll have to turn right. For example, when the robot is here at 2, 2, it will have to turn right, and then move and then turn right again and then move. So let's create a new function called turn_right. So we start out with the def key keyword and then give our function a name which is going to be turn_right. And then we add the parentheses with nothing inside because we're not passing any inputs to this function. We're just going to use this function as a way of defining turn left three times. So when you turn left three times, of course you turn right. And now we have the ability to turn right. So notice how this is the code block for our turn right function and it ends at the last line, which is indented, which is line 4. So every subsequent line which starts at the very beginning of the code file next to the left margin is outside this code block and it will act independently. So in fact, the first line of code that actually runs in our file is going to be this line 6. And you can see that when I press run, you can see that's the first thing that gets highlighted. And if I go through this step wise, you can see the first line is going to be line 6 and it tells the computer to go and find this function called turn_right. So if I skipped to the next step, it's found that, and it's going to start going through lines 2, 3, and 4, turning our robot three times until it has turned right. Now that we have the ability to turn right, let's have a think about how we might be able to get our robot to make one jump. Let's see. The first thing we'd probably want our robot to do is to move forwards by one step, which should take it here. And then the next thing we want it to do is the turn left so that it faces the top. Right? And once it's in this position, then we want to get it to move forward one step, and then we'll probably want it to turn right. Now, notice how I'm actually testing my code at pretty much every other line that I write. And this means that you don't end up in a situation where you get to the end and you've written lots and lots of lines of code, and it doesn't work. In which case you have to comb through all of the code you've written and find out where the problem is. So in this case, we've only got four lines and we've been testing it step wise. So we can see that we're on track and our robot is now turned to the right, ready to move one more step. And then once it gets to here, we have to turn right again and move one more step. Right? And now it should end up here, but let's just check it out. So our robot turns left turns right, turns right again. And it ends up here facing the bottom. So the final thing we need to do is to get it, to turn left once more, so that it will face the forward direction. Right? So once you've confirmed that your code is working, then you should really think about what is the next step, because we've managed to make one hurdle. And notice how, when we're at this position, 3,1, this particular square, it's almost the same as if we were at 1, 1, because we have to move one step again, turn left, move, turn right, move, turn, right, move, turn left. So it's basically repeating all of these instructions, rather than executing these instructions six times, because there are six hurdles. So if I go back and I start, then you'll see that this code actually will complete the challenge. Right? It says I'm done. And we're at the correct position, but notice how many lines of code we've got. We've got something like 58 lines of code. I know I've left some spaces in their so that you can see which parts are repeating, but still that's a massive amount of code for something very simple. Now we know that we can use functions to package a set of instructions together under one name, just like what we've done here with the turn_right. We've packaged the three lines of code turn left, turn left, turn left into a single function called turn_right so that when we need that functionality, all we need to do is just the call the function and add the parentheses at the end. So we can do exactly the same thing with this set of instructions, which basically gets our robot to perform a single jump. So let's create a def and let's call this function jump. And then lets add the parentheses and the colon. And very importantly, all of these lines of code must be indented. So to indent a whole block of code together, you hold down the command key and click the left square bracket or the right square bracket. On windows it's holding down the control key and again, the last square bracket or the right square bracket. So now this basically says that all of these instructions live inside this block of code called jump. And when we call jump, then it will carry out all of these lines of code. So now what we could do to complete the challenge is to simply call this function jump six times. Right? And so now we could again solve this entire problem using just 21 lines of code. And we managed to complete this challenge using two functions that have repeated instructions and then calling the jump function six times. But because we've learned about loops and the range function, we know that we can actually cut this down even shorter. So instead of calling jump six times, we could actually write a for loop that loops through and calls this jump function six times. We could say something like for step in, and remember that these two key words come from the for...in loop and they always have to stay the same. And then after the in keyword, we define the rules for how many times we want our loop to repeat. In my case, I'm going to use in range function. And I'm going to say from 0 to 6, but not including 6. So in this case it will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So that actually going to happen six times. And now I'm going to add the colon. And finally, inside this for loop, I'm going to call jump just once. Now, watch what happens. First it starts off at the for loop, it calls jump and it goes through this once and then it comes back loops again, calls it the next time. And then again, the third time in the loop, fourth time in the loop, fifth time in the loop and six time in the loop. How far did you manage to get? Did you get stuck on this section where we needed to create the for loop? Well, in that case, I recommend going back to the lesson where we covered for loops and reviewing the for loop and the range function in detail before you come back and try to solve this challenge again. It's really, really important at this stage that you've understood and you've mastered some of these ideas because we're going to be using them more and more in the future. Really make sure that you've understood things before you keep going. In previous lessons, I've already mentioned how important it is in Python to be aware of your indentation, so we know that when we create a function like this, that every line that comes after this definition that is indented is going to be inside this function. So by indented I mean it's shifted to the right by four spaces, like this. So if you imagine each dot as a space then this is a single block of code. And if we want to continue adding to this block of code inside my function, then we would continue adding lines of code which are indented. So you have to almost visualize for yourself this invisible line around these blocks of code which are indented. Now, if my code was written like this, on the other hand, then the block of code is in fact only this part and this print statement will not get triggered when this function gets triggered, because it's independent from this function, because it's not indented. Now, a simple way I like to think about this kind of indentation is kind of like the file structure you see when you go into Finder on the Mac, or when you go into Explorer on Windows. If we have a function, it's kind of like a folder and anything that goes inside the function. For example, if I throw this file inside the function, then you notice that it gets indented right? And this way it shows to you very, very clearly that these two files print-hello and print-world are living inside this folder, My Function. And this is the equivalent of this code. We have this folder say, my_function and it contains these two lines of code. Now on the other hand, if I take this print-world and I put it outside of the function folder, then you can see that this is completely independent from that folder, and it's now indented at the same level as the function. So this is the equivalent of this code where we've got this print(\"Hello\") being inside the my_function and this print(\"World\") being outside and at the same indentation level as this function definition. Now the indentation gets a little bit more complicated when we have other blocks of code. So for example, the if, elif, else statements, they have blocks of code which need to be indented to be inside the block, for loops need to be indented to be inside the loop. And it's very important that you get used to looking at blocks of code like this. So for example, if we were to expand our simple my_function and add a whole bunch of code into it, then we would have to indent all of those lines of code by four spaces, represented by the four dots here. Now, if we wanted to have another block of code inside this if statement, then this line has to be indented a further four spaces. So this is the function block. This is the if block. This is the elif block. And you have to be able to see all of this while just looking at the indentation. If we wanted to represent this, then it's almost like creating a new folder. Let's call it the if sky == clear, and this if block goes inside my function, so it's indented. Now if I wanted to have a print statement let's call it print blue inside this if statement. So this is what should be executed if this function gets called and if the sky is equal to clear, well then this line is indented twice and that is the equivalent of four spaces in our code. Like this. Now every time I've talked about indentation, I've been talking about spaces. And actually there's two ways of creating indentation. You don't have to just use spaces, you can also use tabs. And that's created using the Tab key on your keyboard, which can look a little bit like this. Now there's a lot of debate around spaces and tabs where some people prefer using spaces to indent, other people prefer tabs to indent, and there's a lot of people arguing in the coding community. And I think this excerpt from one of my favorite shows really demonstrates this. [Silicon Valley TV show excerpt captions] Richard: Huh. Winnie: Richard, what's wrong? Richard: Nothing. Nothing. Literally. It's all good. Come on. Huh. [laughs] Winnie: Oh my God. Richard: I' m sorry. Winnie: Your roommates were right. You really hate spaces. Richard: No no no no, I don't...it's not hate. Hate is a strong word. Truth be told, I do have a slight preference for tabs, but that's only because I'm anal and because I prefer precision. Winnie: Well, not to pick a fight here, but if you really care about precision, wouldn't you use spaces? But whatever. Once it goes through the compiler, it's the same thing, right? Richard: Yeah, yeah. Technically, yes. I guess I just...I just don't understand why you...anyone would use spaces over tabs. Like, if it's all the same, why not just use tabs? Winnie: Because it could look different on other people's computers. Richard: Tabs create smaller file sizes. All right. I run a compression company. Trust me, I've devoted my life to minimalizing file sizes. It's what I do. I mean, I do not get why anyone would use spaces over tabs. I mean, why not just use Vim over Emacs? Winnie: I do use Vim over Emacs. Richard: Oh, God help us! Okay, uh, you know what? I just I don't think this is going to work. I'm so sorry. I mean, like what? We're going to bring kids into this world with that over their heads. That's not really fair to them, don't you think? Winnie: Kids, we haven't even slept together. Richard: And guess what? It's never going to happen now, because there is no way I'm going to be with someone who uses spaces over tabs. [End of the excerpt] So should you be using spaces or should you be using tabs? The age old question, and the extent to which people obsess over this question really shows. In this 2017 StackOverflow developer survey where they asked the developers, do you use spaces or do you use tabs? And then they compared it against their annual salary and somehow have managed to show that the people who use spaces seem to earn a lot more than the people who use tabs. Now, the official guide from the Python community is in fact to use spaces. So if you click on the section tabs or spaces, they tell you in no uncertain words that spaces are the preferred indentation method. And in fact, in Python 3, you can't mix a code file that uses tabs and spaces for indentation in the same file. And it also tells you that in order to indent a line of code, it should be indented using four spaces. So four hits of the space bar. Now, for a lot of people, that may seem quite inefficient because I have to hit my spacebar, four times in order to achieve a single indent. And you've seen how much we indent throughout our code, so it seems very, very inefficient. But luckily in most code editors, they actually have a setting that allows you to indent using spaces, changing the indent size to four, and when you hit the tab key, it will automatically insert four spaces, which you can tell when you're trying to highlight this space. You can see the cursor is jumping four times. This means that you get to hit tab once, and that your code is in line with the guidance, because behind the scenes, your code editor is inserting four spaces. So I hope that clears up a little bit on tabs versus spaces. And I highly recommend you to head over to the Course Resources and click on the link to go to the Style Guide for Python code, and take a look through the parts about indentation. Now in the next lesson, I've got a quick quiz for you to test your knowledge on indentation. So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson. All right guys, in this lesson I want to talk about the while loop, the loop that will continue going while a particular condition is true. This is a really simple version of a robot that's using a while loop. So in this case, the instruction would be while you are plugged into the wall and you have electricity move forwards. So this is what happens. It will stop once it pulls the socket out of the wall and it stops receiving electricity. Let's compare this against the for loop that we've seen before. So we've seen sort of two flavors of the for loop: one where we're looping through a list of items to do something with each item in the list, and the other is using a range function where we create a range between a and b and then we use every number in that range to do something. For example, in this case would be to print it out. The while loop looks something like this. And in this case, while this particular condition is true, then we go inside the loop and we do something repeatedly. And it's only when the something becomes false does the loop stop. So let's take a look at what the code would look like in real life. So here I have the Hurdle 1 challenge that you did previously. And for this we created a for loop in order to get our robot to jump over the hurdle six times to get to the final destination. Now we could also do the same thing, but using a while loop. And this is how we would do it. Let's say we create a variable called a number_of_hurdles, and we set that equal to six because there are six hurdles. And then we use a while loop to loop through these hurdles until this goes down to zero. So we can say while number_of_hurdles Right, > 0: and then we get it to do something. Well in this case, what we need it to do is to perform the jump function. And at the end of the loop, just before we go back to the beginning, we're going to decrease the number of hurdles, Right by one., -= 1. So now let's go ahead and delete this version using the for loop. And in order to better visualize what's happening here I'm actually also going to add a print statement to print that variable. Right? So now let's step through this. And the first time we enter the while loop, number_of_hurdles equals six, six is greater than zero. Then that is a go ahead to jump into the loop and execute these three lines of code. So now we go in and it performs the jump function. And then once that's done, it comes back, goes onto the next line, number_of_hurdles minus equals one, so six should become five. So now when it executes this print function, we should see five printed. So lets move this little pop up away on the side and let's keep going. So now it's gone back to the beginning of the while loop and it's testing this condition once more: is the number of hurdles, five, still greater than zero. Well, so if it's true, then it goes into the while loop again and performs all of those lines of code. So now it's minus one and it should now be four. And it keeps on going until the point where this condition number_of_hurdles greater than zero becomes false. So now this is the moment where we're going to subtract a further one from our number of hurdles, which is currently one. So that should take it down to zero. And once that's done, this condition is no longer true. Zero is not greater than zero. Zero is equal to zero, but it's not greater. So now this is false and we exit out of the while loop and we end our program. This is what the syntax for the while loop looks like. First, we have the while keyword and then we have some sort of condition that we're going to test. So previously you saw it was number of hurdles being greater than zero, and whenever that condition is true, then it's going to look inside the while loop at the indented lines of code to carry out those instructions, to do this, then do this, then do this. And finally, when it gets to the end of the while loop, it comes back to the beginning and tests this condition again. And if it's still true, then it's going to go through and loop and loop and loop until this condition becomes false at which point it ends an exits the while loop. So now coming back to our Reeborg's World, I want you to click on this dropdown and go to hurdle number 2. Now this is a little bit different. And if you want to see the explanation for this exercise, then simply just click on this 'World Info' and you'll see the explanation. So essentially this hurdle's race is a little bit different from the last one. Whereas the last one we knew that we had to always complete six hurdles to get to the goalpost. In this case, we no longer know where the flag is going to be. So it could be here, it could be here, it could be here, et cetera. And it's going to be set randomly to one of these positions. But what we now get is some sort of condition called at_goal. And if this at_goal is true then it means our robot has landed on a flag. But if this at_goal is not true, then it means that it's not yet reached the flag. So we can use our knowledge of while loops as well as this condition to use our code that we had from previously to get our robot to complete this hurdle race. So you should still have the code from the previous challenge up and all you have to do is to think about how you would create a while loop so that when you run this program and the flag is set randomly... So this time it was set to be here, but the next time I run it, you can see it's now set here. It doesn't matter where the flag is, your robot should be able to detect if it's at flag, if its at the goal, and if it's not then it should continue jumping. Pause the video quickly and see if you can complete this challenge and then come back and we'll walk through the solution together. Right? All right. So first things first, we know that we're going to need to use a while loop and the condition that we're going to be testing for is this one, at_goal. This condition can be true or it can be false. And basically we're looking to see while at_goal is not equal to true, so while our robot is not at the goal, then we want to perform the jump function. So we're going to jump for as many times as it is required until this at_goal becomes true. Another way of expressing this at_goal is not true is to say while not at_goal. So this is what they mean by the negation of this condition. Either way of testing this will work. And now if I hit run, you can see that even though we only need to perform one hurdle, as soon as our robot gets here and it checks that at_goal is true then it will stop this loop. But if our loop goes on for much longer, say the goal is over here, then once it reaches here and at_goal is still false, then it's going to continue jumping until at_goal becomes true. So that required a little bit of mental jujitsu I think because this entire condition has to be true, but this at_goal is actually going to be false until the moment where we reached the goal. So by adding this not we effectively flip this at_goal. So if it was true, becomes false or if it's false becomes true in order to continue jumping while we're not at the goal. I prefer this particular type of syntax because it reads more like English: while not at goal then perform jump. And if it is at_goal then it will stop. And one of the things you might be wondering right now is, so I've learned about the for loop and I've learned about a while loop. And if I can use both of them, why would I choose one over the other? When would I use a for loop? And when would I use a while loop? Well, what I would tend to say is that for loops are really great when you want to iterate over something and you need to do something with each thing that you are iterating over. So for example, if you're iterating through a list and you're saying for each fruit in our list of fruits and you want to be able to say, I don't know, do something with each of these items in here. For instance, it can be as simple as just printing it. Well, then this will require a for loop. You can't do this very easily using a while loop. Now, similarly we've used the range function, right? So for range from one to six print each number in the range. Well this it's also easy to do with a for loop. Now you want to be using a while loop when you don't really care what number in a sequence you're in, which item you're iterating through in a list and you just simply want to carry out some sort of functionality many, many times until some sort of condition that you set. And this is also a good point to mention that while loops are a little bit more dangerous than for loops because in for loops, you're setting ahead of time how many times something is going to run. It's going to stop once it reaches the end of the list of items in this case, and it's going to stop once it reaches the upper bound of the range in this case. But for while loops, they will continue running until this particular condition switches to false. So if you have some sort of condition that actually never becomes false, well then your while loop becomes something known as an infinite loop. Because let's say that our while loop tested while five is greater than three, then carry out these three lines of code. Well, five is always going to be larger than three until the end of time. And so that means your code is also going to run until the end of time, which is probably not what you want in most cases. If instead of saying, while not at_goal, I said, while five is greater than three, then you're going to see this robot perform this jump until eternity. And it's basically going to stop only once it's crashed and timed out. Now every single program at some point in their lives will create an infinite loop. Don't worry about it. Just quit the program, restart and try to prevent this from happening in the future. And very often I find that it's really helpful when you don't know why you're getting an infinite loop to simply just print out your condition. So in this case, if I printed out five greater than three, then it's always going to print true. And it's never going to become false basically. In the next lesson, I've got more exercises coming up for you, namely hurdles 3 and 4. So head over there and put what you've learned about while loops into practice. All right guys, it's time for yet another coding challenge. And this coding challenge is going to put into use what you've learned about while loops, while also testing some of the previous knowledge you got on functions. So I want you to head back to Reeborg's World and change to hurdle number 3. And take a look at the premise for this particular race. Right? Essentially what's happened this time is that the wall placement has become random. So let's say we restart this game, you can see that in this case, there's a wall here, one here, one here, one here. There's four in total. But if we try a different version, then you can see that there is different wall placement each time. Not only don't we know where the wall is going to be, we also don't know how many walls there will be. So code such as what we did before using a for loop telling our robot to jump six times is not going to work. And instead, we're going to have to use the conditions whether if front is clear or whether if there's a wall in front or whether if we're at the goal and also their negations, so not front is clear, not wall in front, not at goal. See if you can use what you've learned about while loops as well as your previous knowledge on if statements and functions to complete this challenge. When you have written the correct code, no matter what kind of wall situation or hurdle setup they have, it should always be able to get to the goal. And while I've been looking at this challenge, I know there is a very, very simple way of bypassing this challenge, which is simply to get the robots go up here and all the way down here, going past all the hurdles. But that's not the point of the challenge. In order to complete this challenge, you must get your robot to follow the path that set out in the dotted lines instead of bypassing it and doing something completely different just to get to the final goal. Pause the video, have a think about this, have a read of the world info popup here, and then think about how you can solve this challenge. So give it a go now. Right? All right. So essentially, if we don't know where the walls are going to be, then we have to test to see if there is a wall in front, or if there is no wall in front. And if there is a wall in front, then we're going to jump. But if there's no wall in front, then we're just going to move forwards. And we're going to do this and test this for as long as we're not at the goal. So we're going to need a while loop that's very similar to our previous while loop that I showed you in the demo. While we're not at goal or rather while this particular condition is not true, then we're going to repeat and loop some lines of code. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to use an if statement to check whether if there is a wall in front. So I'm going to say, if wall in front, if this is true, then I'm going to perform the jump function and get it to jump over the wall. But if there is no wall in front, so namely else, well, in this case, we're simply just going to move forwards. And because our jump function is always going to get us to face the right way, which is this direction here towards the goal, then this move forward by one function is always going to take us in this direction. So let's take a look at this code and let's step through it step by step. So the first thing we're going to check is are we at the goal. At_goal is going to be false. So not false is going to be true. So while this condition is true, we're going to carry out all the lines of code inside. So that means we should jump into this if statement and check is there a wall in front? So at this point, this should be false because there is nothing in front. So it should bypass the if statement and it should go to the else statement. In which case it should move forward by one step. So that's the end of one loop and we go back to the beginning:",
      "for loop in ",
      "for indentation in ",
      "while loops as well. And to learn all of these things, we're going to use the help of something that's very similar to Karel the robot. And this is something I use when I first learnt how to code and it's one of my favorite tools for learning programming especially as we get into more difficult concepts like functions and while loops et cetera. And by the end of the day, we're going to be writing the code that's required to instruct our little robot to be able to complete any randomly generated maze. So that's the goal and if you head over to the next lesson, let's get started and let's start learning about some of these things. Right, Right. Hey, well done for completing day six. Now I remember back  when I was learning how to wind surf, just how hard learning a new skill can be. And I think when you become an adult, this is like a really unfamiliar sensation, learning something new. Because more often than not, you're probably working in a job that you've done for years. You've probably gotten really good at it and you haven't actually needed to struggle to really feel the pain that you feel with learning. And this might be the first time you're doing that for a while. So just as when you get onto a wind surf board and you hit the water a few times really painfully, I just hit my face so many times that, um, you feel like this is too hard, but actually the struggle is necessary. The more you struggle, the more you're learning. So don't interpret the struggle as a bad thing. It's a good thing. It means that you're making progress. So keep going and I'll keep practicing my hat tricks, Right? The first concept I want to introduce you to is something called functions. And just as we perform many different functions could be mother, father, son, daughter, we can also get our code to perform different pieces of functionality. Now if we think back we've actually already come across functions, and I've been referring to them every time we've needed to use one. If you take a look at this link in the course resources, which takes you to the Python documentation, then you can see that Python has a whole bunch of built in functions that we've been using. For example, the len() function, which gives us the number of items in a collection, or the int() function, which turns something into an integer, or the print() function, the range() function, and other ones that we haven't seen yet. We can start typing one of the functions that we've been using a lot, which is the print function. And the reason why we know it's a function is because it's the name of a function followed by a set of parentheses. Now we know that if we put something inside these parentheses say for example (\"Hello\"), then when I run the code, whatever is inside those parentheses will get outputted over here in the console. Now all the functions work pretty much the same. So if I wanted to use the len() function to see, well, how many characters are there in this word \"Hello\", I again put my hello inside the parentheses and because of the parentheses, we know that this is a function. And then I can save the outcome of this length function to a variable. Say let's call it number of characters, num_char. And then I can go ahead and print it in order to view it inside the console. So let's print the num_char, and now you can see that this len() function gets to work, calculates the number of characters, it's 5, and then it gets printed. So all of this functionality has been achieved by these built-in functions from Python like print() and len(). Now what if we wanted to make our own functions? How would we do that? Well, if we want to make our own function, we first start out with a keyword which is called, def, and this is because we're creating or defining our function. Now after the def keyword we can give our function a name. And I'm just going to call it my_function. Now the thing that differentiates a function from a variable however, is the parentheses. So after the name comes the parentheses. And now the final thing, the finishing touch to our function definition is a colon because that says everything that comes after that line and is indented belongs with the function. Let's make a really simple function that just has two lines of code. Maybe It prints \"Hello\", and then it prints. \"Bye\". So now I've created my_function. I've placed the lines of code that are associated with this function, all indented after the definition, but notice how if I go ahead and run my code, actually nothing will happen. And the reason is because we haven't yet executed the function. Now we can define lots and lots of functions ahead of time, and it's only when we actually need it do we go ahead and trigger it. And to trigger it, or in programming lingo, we would say to call the function, all we have to do is type the name of the function, which is my_function, and then to add the parentheses and any necessary inputs. In our case, our function doesn't require any inputs, so we can leave the parentheses blank again. And now if I go ahead and run my code once more, then you'll see that by the time the computer reaches Line 5, it's going to search for this thing called my function. It sees that it was defined right here on Line 1, and it goes through all of the content and executes them in turn, line by line. And that's why we get, Hello and Bye being printed here. So just to recap, this is how we create a function in Python. There's two steps to it. The first step is to actually define the function to specify what it should do, and we do that by first using the def keyword. And then we give our function a name, so for example in this case I called it my_function. And then comes a set of parentheses and a colon. And then after that we get to put the lines of code which will be included in this function. And remember that these lines of code which goes into the function which will be carried out when this function is triggered, must be indented, like this. So once you've defined the function, you've created the recipe, the next step is to actually use it, which in programming lingo we would say calling the function. And we call the function just by specifying the name and a set of parentheses. And once the computer sees this line of code, it'll know to go and carry out all the instructions inside where we defined our function. And to learn about functions, I'm going to introduce you to something that's very similar to Karel the Robot. The robot is going to be something that is just going to perform the tasks that we want it to, and no more and no less. So, for example, if we wanted a robot to go to the store and pick up some milk for us, we can't simply just tell it, \"Oh yeah, just go and buy some milk,\" because it won't know how to do that unless we give it specific instructions such as leave the house, walk two blocks to the right, walk four blocks back, and then two blocks to the right. When you go to the store, give them some money and then take the milk and come back. We have to program each and every step. But say if this functionality of getting the robot to go and pick up some milk for us is needed every single day, then we have to write out all of those instructions day after day, day after day. And at some point our fingers are gonna hurt, right? We're typing so much code that's repeated because we don't have a way of bundling all those instructions together. And that's where functions come in. Functions will give us a way of referring to all those instructions at the same time. That way we can give our robot a single instruction, and it will carry out all of those little steps for us and get us some milk. Now to try this out yourself, I want you to head over to the Course Resources and click on the link that takes you to Reeborg's World. Now Reeborg's World is very similar to Karel the Robot that I showed you earlier on, but it allows us to write Python code and it's very easy to get started. Now we've got this area here which we're going to use to write our Python code, and then once we're done, we can click on play to run the Python code and see the instructions carried out by our Robot. Now if you click on Reebok's keyboard, you can see all of the functions that we can use to command our robot like move() or turn_left(), or build_wall, etc.. Let's see if we go ahead and run this line of code here, move(), what happens? When I click Play\u25b6\ufe0f, you can see that our robot moves forward in the direction that it's facing by one step. So if we wanted it to move say for example three steps, all we have to do is to call the move() function three times. Now let's reset by clicking the Return button to return our robot back to the starting position. Now let's click Play again in order for our robot to carry out the new instructions. Notice how all the instructions were carried out very quickly. To execute each instruction, one step at a time, line by line, we can use this step-through button \u23ef\ufe0f. This button allows us to see how each instruction is executed and after each instruction, it pauses and highlights the next instruction. This is very helpful for debugging. So notice how we're highlighting Line 2. So if I click on step again it's going to carry out that function, and then it's going to carry out Line 3, and finally it reaches the end. And that's the end of our code. Now, in addition, we can use some of the other commands in the keyboard, for example, turn_left(). If I decide to say move() three times, and then turn_left(), and then maybe move() three times again, can you predict which square the robot is going to end up in? Are you ready? Let's go ahead and run the code. There we go. We end up on the square 4, 4. It moves() three forwards, turns_left(), and then moves() three steps again, because that's what we told it to do with our Python code. So now here's a question, if you take a look inside this set of commands, you'll notice that there is move(), and there is turn_left(), but there is no turn_right(), and there is no turn_around. So how could we use a function to create those commands? Because of course, we could just simply write turn_left(), and then turn_left() again. And this would effectively turn the robot around, right? But if we wanted to do that many times, say for example, if we wanted to go to 3, turn around, go back to 1, turn around, go back to 3, then we would have to write code that looks a bit like this. We would have to say move() two times to get to square 3, turn_left(), turn_left(), and then move two times again to get to 1 and then turn_left(), turn_left() again in order to turn around. This is all the code we would have to write to achieve this kind of effect. But instead of all of this, we could just define a new function. So we use the def keyword to say that this code is defining a new function called turn-around(). And this function is simply going to be turn_left() twice. And remember all the code that's going to go inside the function has to be indented. And now instead of writing turn_left(), turn_left(), we can simplify our code by telling it to call the function turn_around(). And we can do that here. And we can do that here. So now when we run the code you'll see that it does exactly the same thing as before. But this time we've cut down two lines of code. So instead of eight lines of code for our instructions, we only now need six lines. And you can see that the more that you need to use this function, the more typing it will save you. But more important than reducing the number of lines of code is that our code has also become a lot more readable, so the turn_around() function is much more clear than having turn_left() twice. Now let's see what happens when we use the step through button. Look closely at how each line in our code is executed. So now we're going to carry out the move() by one, move() by one. And now it's going to call turn_around(), that function. And it jumps over to find this function and carries out the code inside in turn, from the top to the bottom. So turn_left(), turn_left(). And now once that function is done, it goes back to where it was before and continues running, move(), move(), and then turn_around() again. So here's your challenge, try and create a separate function that turns our robot to the right. Pause the video, head over to the Course Resources and click on the link that takes you to Reeborg's World. And then go ahead and create your own function called turn_right(). All right, so this should be pretty simple because all we have to do is to define a new function called turn_right(). And this function is going to simply be turn_left() three times. Because turning left three times is going to effectively turn our robot, right. So even though we only have this one way of turning our robot, we can define our own functions to give it many, many other commands that it could use. So now using this turn_right function(), see if you can write some code that makes our robot draw a little square going from here to here, then to here and back to the beginning. Once you're done and you hit play, this is what should happen. So pause the video now and see if you can complete that challenge. All right so let's go from the beginning. We start out facing right at the position 1, 1. In order to draw the square starting from this way we have to first turn_left(), and then we have to move() one step. And that should take us to here. And now we have to turn_right(), move() one more step, turn_right() again, move() one more step, and finally turn_right() for the last time and move() one more step. So using our awesome function means that we don't have to write out turn_left() three times, each time we need to turn_right(). So our code can just be eight lines long instead of 14 lines long. And we're using our function to cut down on a lot of typing. But not only are there fewer lines of code, look at how much more readable our code has become thanks to our turn_right() function. It's now so much easier to read, turn_right(), and understand what it needs to do rather than seeing turn_left() three times in the code. So now it's easier to read and it's easier to follow the logic in our code. In the next lesson, I've got a challenge for you. Head over there and apply what you've learned about functions to try and solve it. I'll see you there. All right. So now that you've learned about functions, I have a coding challenge for you. If you head over to this link, which is in the course resources and head over to this challenge which is called Hurdle 1, the idea is that we've got a robot here which needs to do a number of hurdles to jump over each of these barriers, to get to the final goal here. Now you need to use your knowledge of functions as well as some of the things you've learned before, such as the for loop or the range function, to be able to achieve this. Now, remember that you can tell the robot to move by typing, move(), and when that's run, it will move by one space. And you can also use, say, turn_left to get the robot to turn left. And in this case, when I run the code, it's going to move one space and face to the left. In order to complete this entire challenge, you can see there's a number of steps that the robot has to go through before it can get to this final goal. And if you were to write out each of these steps, like I have done here one after the other, it would take many, many tens of lines of code. And that's not what we're about. We're programmers. So we're born to be lazy. Try and see if you can minimize number lines of code while still keeping your code readable and understandable by somebody else and be able to get your robot to complete these instructions and take the robot to the final goalpost. And once you've completed the challenge successfully, you should get a green popup that says you're at the correct X and Y position. So pause the video now, head over to this link and give this challenge a go. Right. All right. So how did you get on with this challenge? How many lines of code did it take you to tell this robot to get to the goal? All right. Let's have a think about how we might tackle this. We know that out of the things that we can tell the robot to do, the most useful things are to move and to turn left. But because the robot doesn't have a builtin turn right function, then we have to define that ourselves. And the reason why we need to do that is because you can see that at several points during the hurdle, we'll have to turn right. For example, when the robot is here at 2, 2, it will have to turn right, and then move and then turn right again and then move. So let's create a new function called turn_right. So we start out with the def key keyword and then give our function a name which is going to be turn_right. And then we add the parentheses with nothing inside because we're not passing any inputs to this function. We're just going to use this function as a way of defining turn left three times. So when you turn left three times, of course you turn right. And now we have the ability to turn right. So notice how this is the code block for our turn right function and it ends at the last line, which is indented, which is line 4. So every subsequent line which starts at the very beginning of the code file next to the left margin is outside this code block and it will act independently. So in fact, the first line of code that actually runs in our file is going to be this line 6. And you can see that when I press run, you can see that's the first thing that gets highlighted. And if I go through this step wise, you can see the first line is going to be line 6 and it tells the computer to go and find this function called turn_right. So if I skipped to the next step, it's found that, and it's going to start going through lines 2, 3, and 4, turning our robot three times until it has turned right. Now that we have the ability to turn right, let's have a think about how we might be able to get our robot to make one jump. Let's see. The first thing we'd probably want our robot to do is to move forwards by one step, which should take it here. And then the next thing we want it to do is the turn left so that it faces the top. Right? And once it's in this position, then we want to get it to move forward one step, and then we'll probably want it to turn right. Now, notice how I'm actually testing my code at pretty much every other line that I write. And this means that you don't end up in a situation where you get to the end and you've written lots and lots of lines of code, and it doesn't work. In which case you have to comb through all of the code you've written and find out where the problem is. So in this case, we've only got four lines and we've been testing it step wise. So we can see that we're on track and our robot is now turned to the right, ready to move one more step. And then once it gets to here, we have to turn right again and move one more step. Right? And now it should end up here, but let's just check it out. So our robot turns left turns right, turns right again. And it ends up here facing the bottom. So the final thing we need to do is to get it, to turn left once more, so that it will face the forward direction. Right? So once you've confirmed that your code is working, then you should really think about what is the next step, because we've managed to make one hurdle. And notice how, when we're at this position, 3,1, this particular square, it's almost the same as if we were at 1, 1, because we have to move one step again, turn left, move, turn right, move, turn, right, move, turn left. So it's basically repeating all of these instructions, rather than executing these instructions six times, because there are six hurdles. So if I go back and I start, then you'll see that this code actually will complete the challenge. Right? It says I'm done. And we're at the correct position, but notice how many lines of code we've got. We've got something like 58 lines of code. I know I've left some spaces in their so that you can see which parts are repeating, but still that's a massive amount of code for something very simple. Now we know that we can use functions to package a set of instructions together under one name, just like what we've done here with the turn_right. We've packaged the three lines of code turn left, turn left, turn left into a single function called turn_right so that when we need that functionality, all we need to do is just the call the function and add the parentheses at the end. So we can do exactly the same thing with this set of instructions, which basically gets our robot to perform a single jump. So let's create a def and let's call this function jump. And then lets add the parentheses and the colon. And very importantly, all of these lines of code must be indented. So to indent a whole block of code together, you hold down the command key and click the left square bracket or the right square bracket. On windows it's holding down the control key and again, the last square bracket or the right square bracket. So now this basically says that all of these instructions live inside this block of code called jump. And when we call jump, then it will carry out all of these lines of code. So now what we could do to complete the challenge is to simply call this function jump six times. Right? And so now we could again solve this entire problem using just 21 lines of code. And we managed to complete this challenge using two functions that have repeated instructions and then calling the jump function six times. But because we've learned about loops and the range function, we know that we can actually cut this down even shorter. So instead of calling jump six times, we could actually write a for loop that loops through and calls this jump function six times. We could say something like for step in, and remember that these two key words come from the for...in loop and they always have to stay the same. And then after the in keyword, we define the rules for how many times we want our loop to repeat. In my case, I'm going to use in range function. And I'm going to say from 0 to 6, but not including 6. So in this case it will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So that actually going to happen six times. And now I'm going to add the colon. And finally, inside this for loop, I'm going to call jump just once. Now, watch what happens. First it starts off at the for loop, it calls jump and it goes through this once and then it comes back loops again, calls it the next time. And then again, the third time in the loop, fourth time in the loop, fifth time in the loop and six time in the loop. How far did you manage to get? Did you get stuck on this section where we needed to create the for loop? Well, in that case, I recommend going back to the lesson where we covered for loops and reviewing the for loop and the range function in detail before you come back and try to solve this challenge again. It's really, really important at this stage that you've understood and you've mastered some of these ideas because we're going to be using them more and more in the future. Really make sure that you've understood things before you keep going. In previous lessons, I've already mentioned how important it is in Python to be aware of your indentation, so we know that when we create a function like this, that every line that comes after this definition that is indented is going to be inside this function. So by indented I mean it's shifted to the right by four spaces, like this. So if you imagine each dot as a space then this is a single block of code. And if we want to continue adding to this block of code inside my function, then we would continue adding lines of code which are indented. So you have to almost visualize for yourself this invisible line around these blocks of code which are indented. Now, if my code was written like this, on the other hand, then the block of code is in fact only this part and this print statement will not get triggered when this function gets triggered, because it's independent from this function, because it's not indented. Now, a simple way I like to think about this kind of indentation is kind of like the file structure you see when you go into Finder on the Mac, or when you go into Explorer on Windows. If we have a function, it's kind of like a folder and anything that goes inside the function. For example, if I throw this file inside the function, then you notice that it gets indented right? And this way it shows to you very, very clearly that these two files print-hello and print-world are living inside this folder, My Function. And this is the equivalent of this code. We have this folder say, my_function and it contains these two lines of code. Now on the other hand, if I take this print-world and I put it outside of the function folder, then you can see that this is completely independent from that folder, and it's now indented at the same level as the function. So this is the equivalent of this code where we've got this print(\"Hello\") being inside the my_function and this print(\"World\") being outside and at the same indentation level as this function definition. Now the indentation gets a little bit more complicated when we have other blocks of code. So for example, the if, elif, else statements, they have blocks of code which need to be indented to be inside the block, for loops need to be indented to be inside the loop. And it's very important that you get used to looking at blocks of code like this. So for example, if we were to expand our simple my_function and add a whole bunch of code into it, then we would have to indent all of those lines of code by four spaces, represented by the four dots here. Now, if we wanted to have another block of code inside this if statement, then this line has to be indented a further four spaces. So this is the function block. This is the if block. This is the elif block. And you have to be able to see all of this while just looking at the indentation. If we wanted to represent this, then it's almost like creating a new folder. Let's call it the if sky == clear, and this if block goes inside my function, so it's indented. Now if I wanted to have a print statement let's call it print blue inside this if statement. So this is what should be executed if this function gets called and if the sky is equal to clear, well then this line is indented twice and that is the equivalent of four spaces in our code. Like this. Now every time I've talked about indentation, I've been talking about spaces. And actually there's two ways of creating indentation. You don't have to just use spaces, you can also use tabs. And that's created using the Tab key on your keyboard, which can look a little bit like this. Now there's a lot of debate around spaces and tabs where some people prefer using spaces to indent, other people prefer tabs to indent, and there's a lot of people arguing in the coding community. And I think this excerpt from one of my favorite shows really demonstrates this. [Silicon Valley TV show excerpt captions] Richard: Huh. Winnie: Richard, what's wrong? Richard: Nothing. Nothing. Literally. It's all good. Come on. Huh. [laughs] Winnie: Oh my God. Richard: I' m sorry. Winnie: Your roommates were right. You really hate spaces. Richard: No no no no, I don't...it's not hate. Hate is a strong word. Truth be told, I do have a slight preference for tabs, but that's only because I'm anal and because I prefer precision. Winnie: Well, not to pick a fight here, but if you really care about precision, wouldn't you use spaces? But whatever. Once it goes through the compiler, it's the same thing, right? Richard: Yeah, yeah. Technically, yes. I guess I just...I just don't understand why you...anyone would use spaces over tabs. Like, if it's all the same, why not just use tabs? Winnie: Because it could look different on other people's computers. Richard: Tabs create smaller file sizes. All right. I run a compression company. Trust me, I've devoted my life to minimalizing file sizes. It's what I do. I mean, I do not get why anyone would use spaces over tabs. I mean, why not just use Vim over Emacs? Winnie: I do use Vim over Emacs. Richard: Oh, God help us! Okay, uh, you know what? I just I don't think this is going to work. I'm so sorry. I mean, like what? We're going to bring kids into this world with that over their heads. That's not really fair to them, don't you think? Winnie: Kids, we haven't even slept together. Richard: And guess what? It's never going to happen now, because there is no way I'm going to be with someone who uses spaces over tabs. [End of the excerpt] So should you be using spaces or should you be using tabs? The age old question, and the extent to which people obsess over this question really shows. In this 2017 StackOverflow developer survey where they asked the developers, do you use spaces or do you use tabs? And then they compared it against their annual salary and somehow have managed to show that the people who use spaces seem to earn a lot more than the people who use tabs. Now, the official guide from the Python community is in fact to use spaces. So if you click on the section tabs or spaces, they tell you in no uncertain words that spaces are the preferred indentation method. And in fact, in Python 3, you can't mix a code file that uses tabs and spaces for indentation in the same file. And it also tells you that in order to indent a line of code, it should be indented using four spaces. So four hits of the space bar. Now, for a lot of people, that may seem quite inefficient because I have to hit my spacebar, four times in order to achieve a single indent. And you've seen how much we indent throughout our code, so it seems very, very inefficient. But luckily in most code editors, they actually have a setting that allows you to indent using spaces, changing the indent size to four, and when you hit the tab key, it will automatically insert four spaces, which you can tell when you're trying to highlight this space. You can see the cursor is jumping four times. This means that you get to hit tab once, and that your code is in line with the guidance, because behind the scenes, your code editor is inserting four spaces. So I hope that clears up a little bit on tabs versus spaces. And I highly recommend you to head over to the Course Resources and click on the link to go to the Style Guide for Python code, and take a look through the parts about indentation. Now in the next lesson, I've got a quick quiz for you to test your knowledge on indentation. So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson. All right guys, in this lesson I want to talk about the while loop, the loop that will continue going while a particular condition is true. This is a really simple version of a robot that's using a while loop. So in this case, the instruction would be while you are plugged into the wall and you have electricity move forwards. So this is what happens. It will stop once it pulls the socket out of the wall and it stops receiving electricity. Let's compare this against the for loop that we've seen before. So we've seen sort of two flavors of the for loop: one where we're looping through a list of items to do something with each item in the list, and the other is using a range function where we create a range between a and b and then we use every number in that range to do something. For example, in this case would be to print it out. The while loop looks something like this. And in this case, while this particular condition is true, then we go inside the loop and we do something repeatedly. And it's only when the something becomes false does the loop stop. So let's take a look at what the code would look like in real life. So here I have the Hurdle 1 challenge that you did previously. And for this we created a for loop in order to get our robot to jump over the hurdle six times to get to the final destination. Now we could also do the same thing, but using a while loop. And this is how we would do it. Let's say we create a variable called a number_of_hurdles, and we set that equal to six because there are six hurdles. And then we use a while loop to loop through these hurdles until this goes down to zero. So we can say while number_of_hurdles Right, > 0: and then we get it to do something. Well in this case, what we need it to do is to perform the jump function. And at the end of the loop, just before we go back to the beginning, we're going to decrease the number of hurdles, Right by one., -= 1. So now let's go ahead and delete this version using the for loop. And in order to better visualize what's happening here I'm actually also going to add a print statement to print that variable. Right? So now let's step through this. And the first time we enter the while loop, number_of_hurdles equals six, six is greater than zero. Then that is a go ahead to jump into the loop and execute these three lines of code. So now we go in and it performs the jump function. And then once that's done, it comes back, goes onto the next line, number_of_hurdles minus equals one, so six should become five. So now when it executes this print function, we should see five printed. So lets move this little pop up away on the side and let's keep going. So now it's gone back to the beginning of the while loop and it's testing this condition once more: is the number of hurdles, five, still greater than zero. Well, so if it's true, then it goes into the while loop again and performs all of those lines of code. So now it's minus one and it should now be four. And it keeps on going until the point where this condition number_of_hurdles greater than zero becomes false. So now this is the moment where we're going to subtract a further one from our number of hurdles, which is currently one. So that should take it down to zero. And once that's done, this condition is no longer true. Zero is not greater than zero. Zero is equal to zero, but it's not greater. So now this is false and we exit out of the while loop and we end our program. This is what the syntax for the while loop looks like. First, we have the while keyword and then we have some sort of condition that we're going to test. So previously you saw it was number of hurdles being greater than zero, and whenever that condition is true, then it's going to look inside the while loop at the indented lines of code to carry out those instructions, to do this, then do this, then do this. And finally, when it gets to the end of the while loop, it comes back to the beginning and tests this condition again. And if it's still true, then it's going to go through and loop and loop and loop until this condition becomes false at which point it ends an exits the while loop. So now coming back to our Reeborg's World, I want you to click on this dropdown and go to hurdle number 2. Now this is a little bit different. And if you want to see the explanation for this exercise, then simply just click on this 'World Info' and you'll see the explanation. So essentially this hurdle's race is a little bit different from the last one. Whereas the last one we knew that we had to always complete six hurdles to get to the goalpost. In this case, we no longer know where the flag is going to be. So it could be here, it could be here, it could be here, et cetera. And it's going to be set randomly to one of these positions. But what we now get is some sort of condition called at_goal. And if this at_goal is true then it means our robot has landed on a flag. But if this at_goal is not true, then it means that it's not yet reached the flag. So we can use our knowledge of while loops as well as this condition to use our code that we had from previously to get our robot to complete this hurdle race. So you should still have the code from the previous challenge up and all you have to do is to think about how you would create a while loop so that when you run this program and the flag is set randomly... So this time it was set to be here, but the next time I run it, you can see it's now set here. It doesn't matter where the flag is, your robot should be able to detect if it's at flag, if its at the goal, and if it's not then it should continue jumping. Pause the video quickly and see if you can complete this challenge and then come back and we'll walk through the solution together. Right? All right. So first things first, we know that we're going to need to use a while loop and the condition that we're going to be testing for is this one, at_goal. This condition can be true or it can be false. And basically we're looking to see while at_goal is not equal to true, so while our robot is not at the goal, then we want to perform the jump function. So we're going to jump for as many times as it is required until this at_goal becomes true. Another way of expressing this at_goal is not true is to say while not at_goal. So this is what they mean by the negation of this condition. Either way of testing this will work. And now if I hit run, you can see that even though we only need to perform one hurdle, as soon as our robot gets here and it checks that at_goal is true then it will stop this loop. But if our loop goes on for much longer, say the goal is over here, then once it reaches here and at_goal is still false, then it's going to continue jumping until at_goal becomes true. So that required a little bit of mental jujitsu I think because this entire condition has to be true, but this at_goal is actually going to be false until the moment where we reached the goal. So by adding this not we effectively flip this at_goal. So if it was true, becomes false or if it's false becomes true in order to continue jumping while we're not at the goal. I prefer this particular type of syntax because it reads more like English: while not at goal then perform jump. And if it is at_goal then it will stop. And one of the things you might be wondering right now is, so I've learned about the for loop and I've learned about a while loop. And if I can use both of them, why would I choose one over the other? When would I use a for loop? And when would I use a while loop? Well, what I would tend to say is that for loops are really great when you want to iterate over something and you need to do something with each thing that you are iterating over. So for example, if you're iterating through a list and you're saying for each fruit in our list of fruits and you want to be able to say, I don't know, do something with each of these items in here. For instance, it can be as simple as just printing it. Well, then this will require a for loop. You can't do this very easily using a while loop. Now, similarly we've used the range function, right? So for range from one to six print each number in the range. Well this it's also easy to do with a for loop. Now you want to be using a while loop when you don't really care what number in a sequence you're in, which item you're iterating through in a list and you just simply want to carry out some sort of functionality many, many times until some sort of condition that you set. And this is also a good point to mention that while loops are a little bit more dangerous than for loops because in for loops, you're setting ahead of time how many times something is going to run. It's going to stop once it reaches the end of the list of items in this case, and it's going to stop once it reaches the upper bound of the range in this case. But for while loops, they will continue running until this particular condition switches to false. So if you have some sort of condition that actually never becomes false, well then your while loop becomes something known as an infinite loop. Because let's say that our while loop tested while five is greater than three, then carry out these three lines of code. Well, five is always going to be larger than three until the end of time. And so that means your code is also going to run until the end of time, which is probably not what you want in most cases. If instead of saying, while not at_goal, I said, while five is greater than three, then you're going to see this robot perform this jump until eternity. And it's basically going to stop only once it's crashed and timed out. Now every single program at some point in their lives will create an infinite loop. Don't worry about it. Just quit the program, restart and try to prevent this from happening in the future. And very often I find that it's really helpful when you don't know why you're getting an infinite loop to simply just print out your condition. So in this case, if I printed out five greater than three, then it's always going to print true. And it's never going to become false basically. In the next lesson, I've got more exercises coming up for you, namely hurdles 3 and 4. So head over there and put what you've learned about while loops into practice. All right guys, it's time for yet another coding challenge. And this coding challenge is going to put into use what you've learned about while loops, while also testing some of the previous knowledge you got on functions. So I want you to head back to Reeborg's World and change to hurdle number 3. And take a look at the premise for this particular race. Right? Essentially what's happened this time is that the wall placement has become random. So let's say we restart this game, you can see that in this case, there's a wall here, one here, one here, one here. There's four in total. But if we try a different version, then you can see that there is different wall placement each time. Not only don't we know where the wall is going to be, we also don't know how many walls there will be. So code such as what we did before using a for loop telling our robot to jump six times is not going to work. And instead, we're going to have to use the conditions whether if front is clear or whether if there's a wall in front or whether if we're at the goal and also their negations, so not front is clear, not wall in front, not at goal. See if you can use what you've learned about while loops as well as your previous knowledge on if statements and functions to complete this challenge. When you have written the correct code, no matter what kind of wall situation or hurdle setup they have, it should always be able to get to the goal. And while I've been looking at this challenge, I know there is a very, very simple way of bypassing this challenge, which is simply to get the robots go up here and all the way down here, going past all the hurdles. But that's not the point of the challenge. In order to complete this challenge, you must get your robot to follow the path that set out in the dotted lines instead of bypassing it and doing something completely different just to get to the final goal. Pause the video, have a think about this, have a read of the world info popup here, and then think about how you can solve this challenge. So give it a go now. Right? All right. So essentially, if we don't know where the walls are going to be, then we have to test to see if there is a wall in front, or if there is no wall in front. And if there is a wall in front, then we're going to jump. But if there's no wall in front, then we're just going to move forwards. And we're going to do this and test this for as long as we're not at the goal. So we're going to need a while loop that's very similar to our previous while loop that I showed you in the demo. While we're not at goal or rather while this particular condition is not true, then we're going to repeat and loop some lines of code. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to use an if statement to check whether if there is a wall in front. So I'm going to say, if wall in front, if this is true, then I'm going to perform the jump function and get it to jump over the wall. But if there is no wall in front, so namely else, well, in this case, we're simply just going to move forwards. And because our jump function is always going to get us to face the right way, which is this direction here towards the goal, then this move forward by one function is always going to take us in this direction. So let's take a look at this code and let's step through it step by step. So the first thing we're going to check is are we at the goal. At_goal is going to be false. So not false is going to be true. So while this condition is true, we're going to carry out all the lines of code inside. So that means we should jump into this if statement and check is there a wall in front? So at this point, this should be false because there is nothing in front. So it should bypass the if statement and it should go to the else statement. In which case it should move forward by one step. So that's the end of one loop and we go back to the beginning:"

      "if you want to check out the final program, you can head over to this URL right here. And here, you'll not only see this amazing gavel built out of ASCII but also the secret auction program. So here's how it works. Let's say that I'm going to be the first person logging on to the program. I'm going to give my name and my bid. Let's say I'm going to bid, uh, $53 for this item. And once I'm done with my bid, it asks me whether if there are any other bidders. So if I type yes, then the screen clears and I can hand over the laptop to the next person who's going to make their bid. So let's say there's James, who's going to bid even less than I did. And then he's going to make way for the final bidder, who is going to bid $121. So now at this stage, if everybody is done, then we type, 'no'. And it's going to now tally up all the bids and figure out who bid the highest and give us a winner, printing out, \"The winner is Jenny with a bid of $121.\" There's a number of places that you could use this if you were auctioning some piece of art, or if you're trying to outbid your brothers and sisters on who gets to go on the trampoline. Or if you're trying to start an auction with your friends or coworkers. The silent auction has many, many uses. All right. In today's lessons, we're going to be focusing mostly on the Python Dictionary. But in addition, we're also going to look at how we can nest, say, lists, inside lists or dictionaries, inside dictionaries, and also mixing lists and dictionaries as well. Once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and let's get started with the day. All right. So the first thing I want to talk about is Dictionaries in Python. Now dictionaries in Python work kind of similarly to dictionaries in real life. Right? So if you were to look up a word in the dictionary, say the word code, then you might find the definition as something along the lines of, \"program instructions for the computer.\" And dictionaries are really useful because they allow us to group together and tag related pieces of information. The way I like to think about dictionaries is in the form of a table. Every dictionary has two parts to it. On the left-hand side is the key, and that is the equivalent of the word in the dictionary, and then it's also got an associated value. That would be the equivalent of the actual definition of the word. Now let's say that we took this very simple table of definitions of programming words that we've come across so far, and we go ahead and we try to convert it into a dictionary. How would we do that? Let me firstly drop the last two rows and let's just start with the first one. The first thing we want to do is we want to create a dictionary and to do that in Python, this is what the syntax looks like. ({Key:",

      "for adding in ",
      "if that hasn't already happened to you, then today is your lucky day because that's exactly what we're going to be making. So it's a simple text based calculator, and we can start off by writing a number, and then picking one of the operations, plus, minus, multiply, or divide. So I'm going to divide this by two. And then it shows us the full calculation of 5 / 2 = 2.5. And now we can continue calculating with the answer from the previous step, or we can type n to start a new calculation. Let me type y and maybe I'll do 2.5 + 6, and now I get 8.5. By the end of the lessons today, you will have understood how functions really work, how you can use them to reduce redundant code, and how you can provide inputs to functions as well as providing outputs. Once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and let's get started. To begin, the first thing I want to talk about is more on functions. So we've already seen a couple of things that we can do with functions. The first thing I showed you was how to create a very simple bog-standard function using the def, the name, the empty parentheses, and then the colon, and then within the body of the function, you can do a bunch of things which will be carried out every single time you trigger, or call the function like this. And the first type of function basically just helps you reduce the amount of code you have to write when you have instructions that you want to execute repeatedly. Now the next type of function we saw actually had something inside the parentheses. And this something is an input which can be passed over when we call the function. So in this case 123 is the argument which gets passed in to this parameter called something, and then it gets used within the body of the function. The second type of function, the functions which allow for inputs, gives us the ability to modify the code in the function, and to get it to do something different each time, depending on what input was passed in. We're now onto the final sort of flavor of functions, and these are functions which allow you to have an output once the function is completed. We start off with a simple function, and in this case, you'll notice that even though I could, I'm actually not giving it any inputs, the inputs and the outputs are completely separate from each other. So this is a normal function that you've seen many times now. And within the body of the function I'm going to do some piece of calculation. Let's say I'm going to calculate what is 3 * 2, and then save it to a variable called result. Now once that's done I can use the output keyword, which is return, and then after that keyword I can put whatever it is I want to be the output of this function. So in this case the output is the result. And what that means is when I call this function later on and it runs, then it will go ahead and output this result, and it replaces this line of code where this function was called. Now that result is held in the code where the function was called, and I could save it to another variable. Result of course equals, 3 * 2, and that means this output now equals 6. So this is what the code might look like. Somewhere I would define my function which has an output which you can tell by the 'return' keyword. Now at some other point in my code, I decide to call that function, and once that function executes, that return or whatever is outputted replaces the function call, and at the very end, it means this variable output will store whatever the output is. So in this case, output would be equal to six. The way that I like to think about functions with outputs is almost kind of like a machine, right? If you had a machine where in goes some empty bottles and after some processing or some inputs, out comes a bottle filled with milk. So in this case this function has an input the empty glass bottle, it has an output, the glass bottle filled with milk, and in the middle there's some processes or some code that's being executed to create this change. This ties together all the things that we've learned about functions. So now head over to the starting file for today's lessons. Let's start off by creating a new function, which I'm going to call format_name. And the reason is because this function is going to take a first name and a last name, and it's going to change those inputs, even if it was lowercase or if it was all caps, it's going to change it into title case, something like this, where the first letter is capitalized in each word. To begin, I want you to create this function and then go ahead and add two inputs to it, one called f_name, so first name, and another called l_name, which is the last name. Pause the video and give that a go. All right. So all we have to do to add inputs to our function is just to put the names of these parameters inside the parentheses. So now our function is able to take these parameters as inputs whenever this function gets called. The next step is we're going to convert these strings that get passed in, so it could be something like this all lowercase, it could be all capitalized, or it could be kind of random, right? Like some are capitalized, some are not. But we're going to make it all uniform. So all of these are going to end up like this. And to do this we can search around in Google, and you might come across a similar question in StackOverflow. \"How do you convert a string to Title Case in Python?\" They have an example, and it's trying to do exactly what we're trying to do. If we take a look at the answers, you can see that somebody is helpfully pointing to this title() function. So you take a string and then you write .title(), and then afterwards the string gets transformed and every word now starts off with a capital letter. And if you want to know more about how this title case works, then you can click on that link in title and then have a read through the Python documentation. Once you've read through that, go ahead and modify this f_name and l_name, so that they end up being both in title case. Pause the video and give that a go. All right. So we want to go ahead and take this f_name, and then write a dot, and then write title (.title), to convert it to title case. Once we've done that then we're going to do the same with the l_name. And if we go ahead and actually print these out... And of course in order for the function to actually execute, we'll have to call the function. So I'm going to put two inputs in here, one which is going to be just angela, all in lowercase, and then the second one is going to be ANGELA, all in uppercase. And now when I run this code, you'll see that the result is they both get converted to title case. In essence, this part of the code becomes whatever the previous value of f_name is, converted to title case. You might have spotted already that this title() function actually has an output. It returns a version of the string where each word is title cased. Instead of simply just printing this, we can also capture it inside a variable. Let's create a new variable called formatted f_name, and also formatted l_name. Now what's happening here is we are transforming this input f_name, turning it into title case, and then once this function executes, it has an output, and that output replaces this part of the code. And then it gets stored inside this variable. Now we can go ahead and print the final version of our function, which is going to use an f-string to take the formatted f_name, and then add a space, and then print out the formatted l_name like this. Now if I start out with my first name, but all in strange sort of casing, and then my last name in all caps, let's go ahead and hit Run and see what happens. You can see that my first name gets converted to title case, my last name gets converted to title case, and then that result is stored in formatted f_name. And this result becomes stored in this l_name, and then they get printed and formatted like so. Now instead of printing this result out, we could also return it as well, in the same way that this title function returns, the output replaces this part of the code, we can also do the same with our format_name() function. So let's delete the print function and go ahead and use return instead. Now this formatted string becomes the output. And as we mentioned before what happens with functions with outputs is this output replaces the part of the code where the function was called. Now if this is the string that we want to print, then all we have to do is just to save the output which replaces this part of the code inside a variable like this. And then all we have to do is just go ahead and print that formatted_string. As you can see, when I run the code, the same thing happens. Now you can and you might have alternatively just taken this function call and put it straight inside the print statement. That works exactly the same way, and we can visualize this using Thonny. If I go ahead and paste everything we have inside the editor and go ahead and run Debug, then we can step into and see what are the steps that happen. So the first thing when this Line 6 gets executed, is it tries to call this function format_name(). So it passes in these two inputs. And we're now within the function where we have access to these two inputs f_name and l_name. Now the formatted_f_name becomes the title case version of the first name, and the same thing happens with the last name. So we now have a formatted_f_name and a formatted_l_name, and that is what's going to be returned as the output. Now, once that's completed, that output replaces whatever was in between the print statement, which is where we called this format_name() function. And this is what gets printed into the console. As I mentioned before, we've actually already been using functions that we didn't create that have all of these functionalities, right? For example, the len() function takes an input and has an output. The input is going to be a string, my name again, I seem to be really obsessed with my own name. So now this line of code is going to run this built-in len() function, calculating the number of letters inside this input that we've given it, and then it's going to return the result as an output, which we can now capture inside a variable. This is the input. This is the function. And once this is completed the return or whatever it is after the return statement is going to replace this part of the code, then that result or output then gets stored inside this variable. So this return keyword is really the most important thing in order to create a function that has an output, because everything that comes after it is going to replace where the function was called. Now students often ask me, well, what is the difference then between a print statement and the output? Because it seems like we could use either to get to print to the output area. Well, here is the explanation if you also have this question in mind right now. Let's consider that we create a different function, and this function doesn't actually print its output at all. So let's define a function called function_1(), and it takes some text as input. And all it does is it outputs the original text, but it adds the original text together. So this way if I had the word for example, \"hello\", then the output would become \"hellohello\" like an echo. So now if I go ahead and create another function, let's call it function_2(), and it also takes some text as input, well in this case, this function_2() is going to return the text, but it's going to return it in title case. So we've already seen this before and we know how this works. It's going to take whatever input it is here, make the first letter capitalized and the rest of the letters lowercase. So neither of these functions have a print statement. So let's go ahead and call our first function and pass in a word let's say, \"hello\". Now we can save this to an output variable, and then go ahead and print it. Now you'll see I have that echo thing that I told you about earlier. But now here's the key part, what if, if we take the output of this function_1 and we use it as an input into function_2, how would we do that? Well, we know that the output of function_1, this is in fact a string, and it is a piece of text. So we can then put it into function2 as the input. And we would do it like this function2(), and then brackets, and so now the output of function_1 becomes the input for function_2, and then that input is then title cased. So now if we run our code you'll see that not only do we have the Hellohello functionality being carried out, we've also got the final text capitalized at the beginning. So that's pretty interesting right? We're only able to do this because we understand how the return function works. And we've got two functions that have outputs. And we've effectively chained the output of one function into the input of another one. Now this might mess with your head a little bit, so don't worry. In the next lesson, we'll take a quick look at the return keyword in more detail. Specifically, let's see what happens when we have more than one return statement in the same function. All right, for all of that and more, I'll see you there. In the last lesson, we looked at functions that return some sort of value, we created a function called format_name that returned a string, in this lesson, let's see what happens when a function has more than one return statement. When the computer encounters a line that has the word return on it, then it knows that this line is the end of the function. If I add a line of code after the return keyword, notice what happens when I run this code. It doesn't ever get executed, and this is because the return tells the computer that this is the end of the function, and you should now exit the function. You can actually have multiple return keywords within the same function, and you can even have an empty return keyword. So just the return keyword without anything afterwards. So for example, we could check whether if the f_name is equal to an empty string or the l_name is equal to an empty string. So in this case, it means that when we called format_name(), maybe we didn't give it any inputs. For example, let's say that instead of just calling the function as it is, we actually used the input() function. So, \"What is your first name?\" and \"What is your last name?\" Now what happens is it'll ask us for an input and it will take these two inputs, and then call that function and return the formatted version to be printed. So now in this case, it's possible that we might have just not given it a first name or not given it a last name, And it probably shouldn't go through these lines of code, but at the moment it's still running this function, trying to get the title case from the empty string and then printing it. And I can prove this to you by just adding an extra word in here. So again, empty first name, empty last name, and then it print's result, and then, of course, nothing. How can we get it to bypass the rest of the code? If the user typed in an empty first name or last name? Well, we could use what I mentioned before an early return so we could just write return without anything afterwards, and this is going to escape the function. So it's basically going to terminate the function early. Now this time if I leave an empty first name and last name, you'll see it prints none because there is no output from this to print. Now, of course, it's probably safer to actually return something that tells the developer what's actually going on so we can give a meaningful message like return something like this. So this way we can catch the cases when something is not quite right, and then exit our function instead of wasting time for it to continue working on something that we don't want it to do. We've covered a number of things in today's lesson, and I want you to combine this with your existing knowledge to tackle the challenge in the next lesson to get to grips with this concept of functions with inputs and with outputs. Hey guys, I want to quickly spend a few minutes talking about a concept in Python known as Docstrings. Docstrings are basically a way for us to create little bits of documentation as we're coding along in our functions, or in our other blocks of code. Now, previously we've seen that when we use other functions, like the ones that were already defined by Python, like the len() function, I can see this little piece of documentation that tells me what this function is actually going to do, namely, \"Return the number of items in a container.\" So how can we create the same kind of documentation for the functions that we write? Well, we would do that using docstrings. The docstring has to go as the first line after the declaration. So here we've defined the name of our function the inputs. And then after the colon the first indented line will be the docstring. But that's not it, you also have to use three of these quotation marks, and it's in between these three quotation marks that you can write your documentation. We could write something like, well, what is this format name function going to do? What would we want our future selves or another user who's using this function to know about it? Well, it's going to \"\"\"Take a first and last name and format it...\"\"\" Notice how with docstrings you can actually write strings that are multi-line. Normally, if I was to create a normal string, let's say I don't know, a = (\"A string \") If I hit the Enter key, I'm going to get a warning because it's going to interpret this as the end of this line and it won't see this closing quotation mark as being a part of this string. But when we use a docstring, we can write as many lines as we want, and it will be interpreted all as the same thing all together, as if it was fitted onto the same line, like this. Now that we've added our docstring, it's time to see what it looks like. Now, if I call this function, you can see that the text we wrote here now gets populated in the documentation. \"It takes the first and last name and formats it to return the title case version of the name.\" So this is a way for you to be able to start documenting your functions and giving each function a little bit of an explainer. Now you can also use this as a multi-line comment. So notice how when we write a comment and we go to the next line, it becomes code again. Now you can, in fact, use something like this where you just comment as many lines as you like and this will be interpreted as a comment as long as it's not assigned to anything. So for example, if I create a variable, then this is now a piece of code. Because it's a little bit confusing, the official Python guidance is actually to avoid multi-line comments like this. What is actually much easier is to just write your multi-line comment, and then to highlight all of it, and then to hit cmd + / or Ctrl + / on windows. That's a much better way of differentiating the comment from actual pieces of code. Have a go at adding docstrings to the other functions that you've created, and see it show up when you call your functions. So we're now ready to tackle our final project of the day, and that's building up a Calculator program. If you head over to the link for the final demo project, you can see how it works. So firstly, it asks us for the first number that we want to calculate with, so let's start with 5. And then it asks us to type to pick an operation +  -  *  /. So let's pick a multiply by typing the asterisk sign. Now it asks for the next number. So let's say we want to multiply 5 by 3, so we'll type 3. And then once I hit Enter it will perform the operation using floating point numbers, and then it will give us 15.0. So 3 * 5 is 15.0, but now it asks us to type 'y' to continue calculating with the previous result, 15.0, or type 'n' to start a new calculation. So let's try the first version first. Let's type y, and now it asks us again to pick an operation. So notice how this is repeated, the same as here, the Step 2 here. So now I'm going to pick a different operation let's say add. And now I'm working with 15. So 15 plus, let's say 15 + 5, and let's hit Enter. And now it calculates our final result which is 15 + 5 = 20.0. So notice how in this version it took the result of the previous calculation as the first number instead of asking us for it. And then we picked an operation, and then we added the second number and it performed the calculation. So now we can continue working with the previous result, or we can type 'n' to start a new calculation. And again we loop back to the beginning, and we can start typing our first number, our second number, et cetera. So that's the goal for the final project. But before you do that, there's something I want to show that you can do with functions. So here I've created a function with the name add(). It has two inputs n1 and n2 and it outputs or returns n1 + n2. So you'll notice this is one of the pieces of functionality that's going to be used in our calculator, how to pass in two numbers to perform the addition functionality and then output the result. Now we've seen functions declared like this before, but what you might not have seen is the ability to store a function as a value of a variable. So what does it mean? Well, let's say I decided that adding numbers was my_favourite_operation. Now this is a variable name and you've seen us create variables like this lots of times, right? I could say my_favourite_operation = 3, or my_favourite_operation = \"Hello\", I can add strings, I can add various values to the right-hand side of the equal sign to add a value to a named variable. Now, what you might not have seen is you can also do this with functions. However, if we want to store a function as a value, we can't add the parentheses because as I mentioned before, we trigger a function with the parentheses. The parentheses are also obviously for adding in inputs, but if we just want to store a function to another name, give it another reference, then we would do it like this without the parentheses, only with the name of the function. So now what I can do is because that add() function is now stored under a new reference, my_favourite_operation , I can now trigger that function as if I was using the add() function. So 2 and then comma 3. And if I go ahead and print out the output of this result you'll see I get 5. So this is pretty neat, and it's going to be pretty important in order to create our calculator. So now I want you to perform the first challenge. And I'm going to go through the result of the first challenge, so we set you up correctly for tackling this project. So the goal is to first I want you to do this; I want you to write out the other three functions, it's going to be subtract(), multiply() and divide(). So based on what you know about functions with inputs and outputs, and also obviously these three mathematical operations, create the other three functions:"

      "while loops, different types and blocks of code, before we start talking about this really important concept. Now, if you want to visualize this concept, imagine you have a house with a fence around it and you plant an apple tree inside your garden. Think about who can access those apples, just you and your family, right? But what if instead you had an apple tree in the neighborhood by the sidewalk, for example? Well, this is kind of free for all Anybody can go and access those apples. This is a starting point for how to understand scope. Take a look at the code that's in the starting file and try to understand what it's doing. First I create a variable called enemies and I set it to equal 1. Then I create a function called increase_enemies() and I try to set that variable to 2. Finally, I call my function triggering all the lines of code inside. And now I want you to predict what will this print statement print in the console and what will this print statement print. And it might not be what you expect it to be. So I would expect that here I've got a variable which is equal to 1 when this function is called this variable enemies should now be equal to 2. So when it's printed down here from outside my function this should be equal to 2, and this should also be equal to 2. But look at what happens instead, I get enemies from inside the function equal to 2, but from the outside the function it's equal to 1. So what's going on here? To really understand this, we have to understand the concept of scope. And scope is a really, really important thing in programming. You see it in every programming language, and although it's a little bit different between the programming languages, it all goes back to that concept of the apple tree being within a fence or outside a fence. So let's take a look at some other examples before we come back to solve this problem. The first thing to think about is a concept called Local Scope. Local scope exists within functions. So for example, if I was creating a game and I had a function called drink_potion(), which is somehow going to strengthen my player, well, maybe it would have a variable that's created inside the function. So it could be something like potion_strength, and I could set that to start off with a value of 2. Now in this case, if I was to go and print this variable potion_strength from within the function, notice I'm indented here. And of course I need to call this function for that to happen. Notice what happens when I run the code. It's equal to 2. That's what we would expect, right? But notice what happens if I try to print the potion_strength from outside the function here. This firstly gives me an error right when I'm writing it inside the editor, and when I try to run it, it gives me an error inside the console. And the error is a NameError. And it tells me that the \"name 'potion_strength' is not defined.\" Clearly, I've defined it here, but why can't I access it outside the function? Well, this goes back to the concept of local scope. When you create a new variable or indeed a new function inside another function, it's only accessible, you can only use it when you're inside that function because it has local scope. It's only valid within the walls of this drink potion function. What if we wanted it to be accessible outside the function? Well, now we need to think about something called Global Scope. The only difference between global scope and local scope is where you define or where you create your variables or your functions. So let's say we have a different variable. Let's say that I created a variable called player_health, and it starts off being equal to 10. Now let's say later on I have the same drink_potion() function and this potion has strength of 2. So now inside my function, drink_potion(), if I wanted to print my player health even though it wasn't defined within the function, this is perfectly possible. And if I call my function drink_potion() and then run the code as it is, you'll see 10 being printed. So this has a global scope, it's available anywhere within our file because it was defined at the top level of the file. Now when I say top level, I don't mean physically at the very top of the file. I mean that it's not within another function like potion_strength() here, because this is defined indented inside a function. So this is a local variable, whereas this is a global variable. And global variables are available within functions no matter how deep it gets nested. And it's also available outside of functions. This concept of global and local scope doesn't just apply to variables. As I alluded to before, it also applies to functions and basically anything else you name. This is a concept called the Namespace. So we defined this variable player_health, we define this function drink_potion, anything that you give a name to has a namespace. And that namespace is valid in certain scopes. This concept of scope applies to basically anything you name. If I was to nest this function drink_potion() inside another function, let's call it game(), well, this drink_potion() now has local scope within the function of game(). So this is why this line is now erroring out because it can't actually see inside this function. So now in order to call this drink_potion(), I have to be within the four walls of the game() function. So whenever you give name to anything, a function or a variable, you have to be aware of where you created it. Now it's easy to notice where you've created functions. We have the def keyword right? But when you create a variable, that's the first time that you give it a name and you set it equal to something. And where you write that line of code defines the scope of that particular variable. Here it's outside of every other function, whereas here it's inside a function actually nested two levels deep, so it has local scope to this function. Now, unlike some other programming languages, if you've come from, say, C++, or Java, there is no such thing as Block Scope in Python. What this means is that if you were to create an if statement, say if 3 > 2:",
      "if you take a look at the final demo project for Day 12, you'll see that we've got a Guess The Number game. So, \"Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\" Now in the demo, there is a little bit of answer text which you won't have in your final game, but this is just to make it a little bit easier for us to test this game. So the correct answer is 100, which we already know. Now we're asked to choose a difficulty, 'easy' or 'hard'. Now if we choose easy, it means we have 10 attempts to guess the number. And if we guess a number and it's too low, it'll tell us that it's, 'Too low'. And if we guess a number that is too high, then it will be, 'Too high', until we somehow figure out the correct answer, which in this case happens to be 100. Now, if we go ahead and try the hard mode, you can see we only have 5 attempts to guess the answer, and we have to be able to get there using these clues of low or high to try and guess the correct answer. So this is what we're going to be building, and in the process, we're going to be covering a lot about Scope, about Global variables, about a lot of the stuff that we've sort of started to think about and to use in our code, but formerly we haven't yet really approached. So that's what we're going to be doing. And once you're ready, head over to the next lesson. Well done on completing day 12. Now, one of the things that I really, really want to say to everybody is don't be so hard on yourself, because I know that I do it too, you know. Sometimes your inner voice says, \"Oh, I can't believe you missed a day.\" Or like, \"why couldn't you get the answer the first time?\" It doesn't mean that you failed. As long as you keep trying, you're succeeding. So don't worry if you've missed a day here or there, don't worry if you had to do one day in two days or if you didn't get solutions straight away. As long as you keep going at it, you're going to succeed eventually. And remember, I believe in you. The first thing I want to talk about is a concept known in programming as Scope. And this scope is something that we've actually come across already in our programming, but I wanted to leave it until we've seen functions, we've seen if and while loops, different types and blocks of code, before we start talking about this really important concept. Now, if you want to visualize this concept, imagine you have a house with a fence around it and you plant an apple tree inside your garden. Think about who can access those apples, just you and your family, right? But what if instead you had an apple tree in the neighborhood by the sidewalk, for example? Well, this is kind of free for all Anybody can go and access those apples. This is a starting point for how to understand scope. Take a look at the code that's in the starting file and try to understand what it's doing. First I create a variable called enemies and I set it to equal 1. Then I create a function called increase_enemies() and I try to set that variable to 2. Finally, I call my function triggering all the lines of code inside. And now I want you to predict what will this print statement print in the console and what will this print statement print. And it might not be what you expect it to be. So I would expect that here I've got a variable which is equal to 1 when this function is called this variable enemies should now be equal to 2. So when it's printed down here from outside my function this should be equal to 2, and this should also be equal to 2. But look at what happens instead, I get enemies from inside the function equal to 2, but from the outside the function it's equal to 1. So what's going on here? To really understand this, we have to understand the concept of scope. And scope is a really, really important thing in programming. You see it in every programming language, and although it's a little bit different between the programming languages, it all goes back to that concept of the apple tree being within a fence or outside a fence. So let's take a look at some other examples before we come back to solve this problem. The first thing to think about is a concept called Local Scope. Local scope exists within functions. So for example, if I was creating a game and I had a function called drink_potion(), which is somehow going to strengthen my player, well, maybe it would have a variable that's created inside the function. So it could be something like potion_strength, and I could set that to start off with a value of 2. Now in this case, if I was to go and print this variable potion_strength from within the function, notice I'm indented here. And of course I need to call this function for that to happen. Notice what happens when I run the code. It's equal to 2. That's what we would expect, right? But notice what happens if I try to print the potion_strength from outside the function here. This firstly gives me an error right when I'm writing it inside the editor, and when I try to run it, it gives me an error inside the console. And the error is a NameError. And it tells me that the \"name 'potion_strength' is not defined.\" Clearly, I've defined it here, but why can't I access it outside the function? Well, this goes back to the concept of local scope. When you create a new variable or indeed a new function inside another function, it's only accessible, you can only use it when you're inside that function because it has local scope. It's only valid within the walls of this drink potion function. What if we wanted it to be accessible outside the function? Well, now we need to think about something called Global Scope. The only difference between global scope and local scope is where you define or where you create your variables or your functions. So let's say we have a different variable. Let's say that I created a variable called player_health, and it starts off being equal to 10. Now let's say later on I have the same drink_potion() function and this potion has strength of 2. So now inside my function, drink_potion(), if I wanted to print my player health even though it wasn't defined within the function, this is perfectly possible. And if I call my function drink_potion() and then run the code as it is, you'll see 10 being printed. So this has a global scope, it's available anywhere within our file because it was defined at the top level of the file. Now when I say top level, I don't mean physically at the very top of the file. I mean that it's not within another function like potion_strength() here, because this is defined indented inside a function. So this is a local variable, whereas this is a global variable. And global variables are available within functions no matter how deep it gets nested. And it's also available outside of functions. This concept of global and local scope doesn't just apply to variables. As I alluded to before, it also applies to functions and basically anything else you name. This is a concept called the Namespace. So we defined this variable player_health, we define this function drink_potion, anything that you give a name to has a namespace. And that namespace is valid in certain scopes. This concept of scope applies to basically anything you name. If I was to nest this function drink_potion() inside another function, let's call it game(), well, this drink_potion() now has local scope within the function of game(). So this is why this line is now erroring out because it can't actually see inside this function. So now in order to call this drink_potion(), I have to be within the four walls of the game() function. So whenever you give name to anything, a function or a variable, you have to be aware of where you created it. Now it's easy to notice where you've created functions. We have the def keyword right? But when you create a variable, that's the first time that you give it a name and you set it equal to something. And where you write that line of code defines the scope of that particular variable. Here it's outside of every other function, whereas here it's inside a function actually nested two levels deep, so it has local scope to this function. Now, unlike some other programming languages, if you've come from, say, C++, or Java, there is no such thing as Block Scope in Python. What this means is that if you were to create an if statement, say if 3 > 2:"

      "If you've managed to get to this point you've probably written quite a bit of code already. And I will bet that you've probably made some mistakes, some typos, some errors, and some bugs. So in this lesson, I want to talk about some techniques and tips for how to find bugs and how to get rid of them from your code. Now, the first documented bug was actually found by this lady, Grace Hopper. She was probably one of the first programmers and one of the pioneers of the job that we're undertaking right now. Now, in her notes, you'll find a moth that's been taped to the notebook. And this was found in a relay that was preventing her code from running properly. and this was pretty much the first actual case of a bug that's been found in a computer. Even though we're not dealing with moths these days anymore, we're still going to end up finding bits of things in our code that prevent the code from doing the things that we want it to. The important thing to remember is don't feel down when you've created a bug because everyone gets bugs. And when I say gets bugs, I mean we create them, right? So once you've gotten over this next, I want to talk about some of the tips and techniques that you should follow on how to quickly be able to identify and remove these bugs. So the first step is to describe the problem. If the problem is messy and it's not well understood in your head, then it's almost impossible to debug it. So untangle the problem and try to make sense of what's going on. Now, in this block of code, we're going to practice describing the problem to help us solve this debugging problem. Now if you take a look at this function, you can see that at some point in the function, we're supposed to print this line out into the console. But if we go ahead and hit Run you can see that nothing gets printed. So what's going on here? I want you to take a look at this function and describe the actual problem. What is the for loop doing? When is the function meant to print? You got it. What assumptions are you making about the value of i? So pause the video, read the function and have a go at describing the problem. All right. So what we've got here is we've got a function that loops through all the numbers between 1 and 20, and then once that number reaches 20, it's supposed to print, \"You got it\", but the problem is that when i reaches 20, it doesn't print this line into the console. So now that we've described the problem, and we understand what's going on, let's see if we can solve it. If we think about this problem when i reaches 20, it doesn't print out this line. There's an assumption in there, right? The assumption is that i will definitely reach 20. But if you think back to how the range function works, the stop or the upper bound is actually omitted. So when you write range 4, it actually produces a number from 0 up to 3. And in our case, when we write 1, 20, it actually goes from 1 all the way up to 19, but not including 20. The problem here is that i actually never reaches 20, so this assumption is completely false. Pause the video and see if you can fix the code so that this line actually gets printed. All right. So all we need to do is change this to 21 instead of 20, and now when we hit run you can see it actually works, and we manage to debug this problem. Always when you come across a problem in your code, try to describe it so that you really understand what the issue is, and then test your assumptions and see which of those assumptions is actually false. Well done for completing day 13. Now you might still be thinking, \"Hey Angela, I've completed 13 days and I still don't feel all that confident about writing code in Python. What's going on here? Am I just not meant to be a programmer?\" What I would have to say to you is, you know, confidence is earned. Like, you can only go so far pretending to be confident. But once you've gone over a number of hurdles, once you've solved problems that you've never solved before, then you start building up those skills. And then the next time you encounter something hard, you'll think back and you'll think, well, this is not as hard as that other thing I did before. So as you keep jumping over hurdles, as you keep solving difficult things, as you keep struggling and overcoming it, you're going to build confidence in your programming. So, again, just keep going. You got this. Now, the next step is to think about reproducing the bug that you've encountered, because when you encounter it once but you don't encounter it the next time, that becomes a really difficult bug to fix. In this section, we're going to try and reproduce the bug. So when we run the code, sometimes it will work and it will print out one of the dice_images from this list, but occasionally you will get an error. These types of bugs are really difficult because you might test your code only once or twice and it looks all fine. It works, but then occasionally you get an error. And the important thing is to reproduce that error. When does that error actually happen? And based on that knowledge, we can fix our code. Try to reproduce the bug yourself and try to notice when it happens, and see if you can change the code so that it always produces this error. We've got a list of dice_images which are just emojis, and we've also got this random number, dice_num, between 1 and 6. Now, when we try to pick out of our list, occasionally, we get an error. Now we have to notice when the error occurs, and to reproduce the bug, we have to figure out which of these numbers is actually causing the problem. So we know that this is a random number between 1 and 6. And if we check the documentation, it tells us that randint() works a little bit differently from range(), it will return a random integer in the range of A and B, including both end points. So in our case, both 1 and 6 could be generated and it could be any number. So if that was equal to 1 well does it generate an error? No. It just picks out this particular item. But what if it was 2, or 3, or 4? Or what if we tested 6? Well, now every time we hit run, you can see we get an error. And now that we've got our error to show up consistently, it's a lot easier to debug because we know that the 'IndexError:"

      "if you want to have a go at it just go over to higherlowergame.com and click on Classic. So the classic version of higher lower is you compare one search term, \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" which is a movie against another search term, \"AFL\", which is the Australian Football League. And you have to say if the second one has higher or lower searches than The Grand Budapest Hotel. So I think this probably has higher, and indeed I'm right. And now it gives you a new term to compare. So \"Six Nations\" Rugby versus \"AFL\", who has lower? I think this probably has lower, and I'm right. And you keep going until you get it wrong. And it's a weirdly addictive game for some reason. Okay, so now I've gotten it wrong and it tells me how many I got right as my score, and I can play again if I wish to. Have a play around with that game, because the final version we have looks a lot simpler, but it's still just as fun to play. Instead of comparing average monthly searches on Google, we're comparing who has more followers on Instagram. So we're bringing this game up to date. In this case, it's comparing Neymar, a footballer from Brazil, against Khloe Kardashian, a reality TV personality and businesswoman from the US who has more followers. So I think it's 'B', I could be wrong and I'm wrong. So here we're comparing Rihanna, a musician and businesswoman from Barbados, against Shakira, a musician from Colombia. So I'm going to guess probably Rihanna, and I get it right. So I get to score one point and this game continues on and on, until you get to the point where you get it wrong, same as the one that you saw before. And there we go. So I got 3 as my final score, and that's the end of the game. The aim of the game is to try and stay alive for as long as possible, and score as high as possible by thinking about who might be more popular than the other. Now here comes the interesting part, you're going to be coding up this game entirely by yourself. You're going to apply everything you've learned so far to understand how this game works by playing it quite a few times, going to this URL, and looking at all the specific nuances. What happens if you get it wrong? What happens if you get it right? And you're going to write the code all yourself, and you're probably going to need your skills of debugging to fix some problems as you go along as well. So the approach that I want you to take is first, think about the problem and then break down a large problem into smaller problems. This way you can tackle them one by one and it won't be so intimidating. Now step two, is to look at those problems and make a TODO list. Given the items on the TODO list, you're going to pick the one that you think is the easiest to begin. Let's say that maybe generating a random number. That's pretty simple, right? Well, in this to do list, that's the first one we're going to tackle. So in this case we're building a very simple dice game. Right? The game that you're going to be building is a lot more complex, it won't just have three to dos, but the idea is the same. Once you pick the task that you think is the easiest, generating a random number, then you're going to take that problem and you're going to break it down into comments in your code. So just as you've seen me do it for our previous projects, you're going to do the same thing. You're going to take that problem of generating a random number and then split it into different pieces. Right? First you probably have to import the random module, and then you probably have to use a function like randint() to generate a random integer. So now that you've taken a big problem and broken it apart into smaller problems, taken the easiest, smaller problem and break it down into comments in your code, then you're ready to start writing some code. So write code beneath the comments. Run your code, make sure that it does what you want it to do, and if it doesn't, then fix the code. And once you've done that, then it's back to the beginning, write more code under the comments, run more code, fix more code until you've managed to cross out that task. And then it's a case of tackling the next one that you think you can attempt. So this is the real skill of programmers taking something that's immensely complex and difficult, breaking it down into smaller problems, breaking it down further and then tackling them from the easiest to the hardest, and doing this one by one. Eventually, by the end, you end up with your final product. This is what I want you to do. So the first thing you are to do is to head over to the final version of the game, play it at least ten times just so you understand exactly how it works. Now you'll notice that there's three files in the starting code. One is the art.py that contains the logo and the versus symbol that shows up when it asks you to compare. So compare 'A' Cristiano Ronaldo versus 'B' Vin Diesel. And these are the art that you're going to display. And finally, and probably most importantly there is a file called game_data. Now game_data only contains a single variable. It's a list of dictionary entries. Each of these dictionaries have four keys, and the keys are the same for all of the entries. They've got a 'name', the name of the account, the follower_count, so how many followers in millions does that account have? So for example, Cristiano Ronaldo has 215 million followers, at least at the time when I compiled the data. And then it has a description, he's a footballer, or this is a social media platform, she's a musician and actress, and finally, the country that they're from. You're going to use all these pieces of information to construct a comparison line like this, \"Compare A: Cristiano Ronaldo, a footballer from Portugal with B...\" and you're going to ask the user to guess who has more followers, and if they get it right, they get to keep playing, where A now becomes the previous B. So Vin Diesel, who used to be B, now becomes A, and then you get to compare against a new person and it keeps on going until they get it wrong. That is the task ahead of you, and it's not going to be easy, but I think you can do it. So give this project at least an hour. You'll need to write the code, you'll need to fix problems, you'll need to debug, you'll need to test it quite a few times, but by the end of it you will emerge a stronger programmer, I promise. So good luck and make sure you have lots of struggle and I'll see you on the other side. All right, so I really hope you've given this challenge a good go, and you've spent at least an hour toiling over it and struggling, and you should be wiping sweat off your brows before you come and look at the solution. The struggle is so important and I can't stress it enough, but in this lesson I want to run through how I would tackle this problem. Now, it doesn't mean that you have to do the same thing, there isn't one solution. There's probably thousands of different solutions for a project like this. And as long as your program runs exactly the same way, then you've succeeded. It doesn't matter at this stage how you've done it necessarily, as long as you managed to organize your thoughts, break down the problem, and write the solution code and get it to run, then you are victorious. The real challenge in today's project was for you to break down a big problem into smaller, solvable chunks. It isn't even so much the code that matters, it's this skill that you really need to develop to become a really good programmer. And so far, I've been breaking down the problem for you, showing you the steps that would take you to the solution, but now you're really wearing the big programmer pants and you're doing it all by yourself. So let's think about this problem and how we would break it down. There's some easy problems here, right? We need the art to display... So let's add a comment for each problem we identify. We've got the ASCII art showing up here, and we've got the Vs showing up here. Now the next one is we've got these randomly generated accounts, from the data. So we've got Camila Cabello and Emma Watson. How do we get these random accounts to show up, that's another problem. Right? So we know that we've got all of this game data here in the format of a dictionary that's nested inside a list, and we need to figure out a way of pulling out a random account from this list. So that's another problem I've identified. Now, the next thing you'll notice is that the data contains many key/value pairs, the name of the account, the description, et cetera, but when we display it, it's all nicely formatted, the name, and then what they do, and then where they're from. We'll have to add that as probably another problem to solve. How do we format the account data into a printable format? Okay, so let's say we solve that and we've got A and B. Now we have to ask the user for a guess. Guess who has more followers. So that's another problem to solve. And when they do type an answer, let's say we think maybe A has more followers, then it's going to have to check that answer and see if it's correct or if it's wrong. So that's going to be a big problem, \"Check if user is correct,\" because that's going to require a couple of things, right? We're going to probably have to break down this problem into smaller problems if we want to solve it. So for example, we probably need to figure out the follower count of each account, and then we'll probably need to use an if statement to check if user is correct. Now, if we get it right or if we get it wrong, the game is always going to give us some feedback. \"Sorry, that's wrong...\" or \"You're right!\" So let's add to our problem list. Now, in addition to giving them feedback, whether if they got it right or whether if they got it wrong, it also has a way of tracking score, right? Every time they get an answer right, the score goes up by one. In addition to all of that, the game repeats itself when the user gets it right. So let's say in this case, I guess a Dwayne Johnson, then you see how the game repeats itself, right? It goes back and it takes Dwayne Johnson, puts it in position A and generates a new account in position B for me to go again. So I get another round because I got it right. So we'll need to address that in our code as well. Have some sort of way of, \"Make the game repeatable.\" And it's not just repeatable actually, because we also have to move the previous B up to the A position if they do get it right for the next round. So I think Khloe Kardashian maybe has less, oh. So let's say I guess Dwayne Johnson again in this case. Now if I get it right, Taylor Swift, who used to be at position B, now gets moved to position A ready for the next round. So this is another problem we have to tackle. So not only does the game have to be repeatable, we also have to have some sort of way of making the accounts at position B become the next account at position A. That's it, I think, for now. I've broken down this large problem, which is build this game into a bunch of smaller problems, and as we code along, we're probably going to break them down even further. This really was the key skill that I wanted to test you on, being able to take a big project, turn it into smaller problems, and then tackle them one by one. So if you managed to get this far, and you've managed to identify all the problems that you need to solve, you're ready to consider yourself successful. Now the next stage, we're going to try and tackle each of these one by one and be able to create the final version of the game. Let's get started. Now the first thing is probably the easiest, so I'm going to start from there to display the art, which is going to be the logo to begin with. I'm going to have to import that art file, and I'm going to use the, 'from art import logo', this way I don't have to write art.logo every time I want to use it. Now I can simply just write, print(logo). So that's the first one tackled. That was pretty easy. Some of them are going to be a lot harder than that. The next one is to generate a random account from the game_data. And remember the game_data is here in a separate file, and the data is held inside a variable called data. So let's go to the top and let's do the same thing, so, 'from game_data import data'. And now we can use that data to generate a random account. In order to generate a random item from that list we have to use the Random Module. So I'm going to import the random module. And I can use that random module to tap into the choice() function and pass in my data, which is a list. So this function is going to take this list and then find a random entry in there, which will give me a random account. Let's call this account may be, account_a and set that equal to the output from this random.choice() function. Now I'm probably going to need more than one random account, because I need to compare A against B. By calling random.choice() on data again, I make sure that I get a different random account. So at this point, we've got account_a and account_b, which hopefully are different from each other, but if you wanted to, you could in fact check and just make sure. So if account_a == account_b, then, in this case, you make sure that account_b is regenerated. Often as you're coding along tackling the problems, smaller problems arise and you start thinking about what could happen, and you start addressing that with code as well. So I think we're now done for this second problem, and we're ready to move on to the next one. Let's format the account data so that we can print it out in this format. So the account name, and then 'a', and then whatever it is that they do, and finally from and where they're from. So we know that the data of each of these accounts is basically a dictionary, and we know that we access dictionaries using the key/value pair, so we could, for example, access the account_name by tapping into the random account, let's say, account_a, and then we use that square bracket, and then we put in the key in here, which let me just check, is the name. So let's put that right here. And this will go into that dictionary, and pull out the value under the key name, and save it to this variable. And we can do the same thing for the other two pieces of data we need. And just make sure that you don't have any typos in your keys here, because remember they need to match these precisely in order for it to not error out. Now that we've got all of these pieces of data, we can now print the final version. So we're probably going to use an f-string to insert all of these pieces of information. And we'll probably start off with the account_name and then a comma, we can write 'a' and then put in the account_descr. And finally, put 'from' and the account_country. That's pretty much it. But notice how I've done this just for account_a, and I actually have to do it for both account_a, and account_b. So instead of repeating all of this code, it might be a lot easier if I actually pull this out into a separate function. So let's create that here. Let's create a function that does this. I'm going to turn this into a docstring to explain the function, and I'm going to call the function format_data(). And it's going to take an input which is the account. And now using this account we can make this more reusable by deleting the _a part of it. And of course we need to indent everything over so that it's actually within this function. And instead of printing the final outcome I'm going to return it as the output. So now we can call that function down here, and we can pass in each account in turn. For example, we could say print, Compare A, which is going to be the first account. So we're going to use our f-string to insert the data that we get back from our function call, and I'm going to call it within the print statement. You can of course take it out and create a separate variable, but I think this should be clear enough to see what's going on. So we're going to call format_data, and we're going to pass in the account_a for this first line, and then I'm going to do the same for B. So in this case I'm going to pass in account_b, and it's going to format the data and then print it out. So as I always say it's a good idea to run your code frequently, probably any time you solve a problem you should probably run it and see if it works the way you expect it to. So the first one, the logo gets printed. The second one, we've managed to get some random accounts because every time I run it, the accounts should be different. And finally, we format the account into this format, with their name, their description, and their country all written out from the print statement, using this lovely format_data() function we've created. We've already done really well, so let's keep going. Now, at the moment it just says compare A, compare B, but instead it'd be much nicer if we can put in that art the Vs ASCII art in between the A and B. Now you could write the line again, 'from art import vs,' but instead, you could also just add a comma here and write vs. So now it's going to import both the logo and that Vs art. And we're going to put it right here. So we're going to use a print statement. And instead of using a string inside double quotes we're just going to write the name of the variable which is called vs. And if we take a look at the final version you can see it also says, Compare A Against B, so we'll change the second word to Against. And now when we run the code, it should look pretty much identical to the starting point of our final game. Let's tackle the next problem. We need to ask the user for a guess to see who has more followers. Right? So I'm actually just going to copy this string right here. And I'm going to put that into an input. \"So who has more followers? A or B:"

      "if you're at home and you decide that you really wanted a latte instead of your usual black coffee. Now, in addition, the coffee machine has some resources that it has to manage. So it starts out with 300 ml of water in the tank, 200 ml of milk, and 100g of coffee. The second feature of our coffee machine is that it's coin operated. So we're going to be using American coins. And they have four types of coins the Penny, the Nickel, the Dime, and the Quarter. They used to also have the Dollar as a coin, but a few years ago they stopped minting that. So we're not going to count it, and it probably means one less if statement for us. Notice what each of these coins are worth. The penny is worth a cent, the nickel worth $0.05, and the dime $0.10, and the quarter is a quarter of a dollar. These represented in decimal values would look something like this. Now here's the important part, let's think about what our program requirements are if we break it down. One we need our coffee machine to be able to print a report. It needs to be able to tell us what resources it has left, how much water has left, how much milk, et cetera. So let's say that we wanted a report on all the resources that the machine has. All we have to do is type report and we can see all the resources we have. Now, in addition to being able to print a report, we also want to be able to check that the resources are sufficient when the user orders a drink. Now let's say that the user decided to order a latte. It asks me to insert some coins and then it gives me the change and it gives me the latte. But now if I check the report, I can see that I've only got 100 ml of water left, and I know from the previous slide that a latte and a cappuccino is going to need more than that amount of water. So let's see what happens if I go ahead and order a cappuccino. It says, \"Sorry, there's not enough water.\" So our program is able to look through all the resources that the machine has, checks it against the recipe of the drink that we're trying to make, and tells the user if there is insufficient water or if there's insufficient milk, and as long as one of the resources is insufficient, then it can't make the drink and it gives the feedback to the user. Now, as you saw before, our program also needs to be able to process coins because our machine is coin operated, so no fancy contactless payment or pay with your Apple Watch, none of that. We've only got coins. When we order something, it should ask us to insert coins, and it's going to ask for the quantity of each type of coin. So let's say that I insert one of each. Then in this case, there's actually not enough money to cover my drink, and it refunds the money and doesn't give me a drink. But on the other hand, if I do insert enough money, then it should be able to calculate how much money all of these coins are worth and then calculate the amount of change based on the cost of my drink, and then it should hand me my drink, and tell me to enjoy. So in addition to being able to process the four types of coins, calculating the actual monetary value based on the number of coins, it should also check that the transaction is successful, that the user didn't try to hoodwink us by not giving enough coins and asking for a drink. So if they haven't inserted enough coins, then we're just going to refund them and tell them, \"Sorry, that's not enough money\" and not give them their drink. But if the transaction was successful, then we're going to make the coffee, and in the process of making the coffee, we're going to have to deduct the resources. Notice how every time we make a drink say, in this time we made a latte, and previous to the latte we had 300ml of milk. But after the latte, when we asked for the report, you can see that the water has been reduced, the milk has been reduced, the coffee has been reduced, and the money has been put into the coffers. This program, even though it seems simple, just a simple digital version of a coffee machine, it actually has quite a few requirements. Now I've created a detailed program specification for you as a PDF file, which you can download in the Course Resources, and this goes into a lot more details on each of those points. For example, what should the prompt print in the beginning of the program, and then how to turn the machine off, how to print the report, and how each of those points should work in detail. Go ahead and download this and make sure you read each of the sections and test it out in the final working version of the project. Once you're ready, you can go ahead and head over to the starting version of the code, and I want you to create a new project using PyCharm and call it CoffeeMachine. And then create a new file inside your project called main.py, and then paste all of the starting code into your main.py. And now you're going to code inside this file. And once you're ready, you're going to click Run, and you'll be able to run this main.py down here, and this will act as your console. So if I go ahead and take some of these program requirements, I can put them in as TODOs. To create a TODO you have to follow the syntax. First is a pound sign #, and then we write TODO in all caps. And notice how that's just changed color just now. And now you can see in the TODO tab it's found one TODO item. Now we can write TODO Number 1, and this is to print a report of all the coffee machine resources. Now let's say that I created a TODO somewhere else, right? Like all the way up here. \"Check that the resources are sufficient to make the drink order.\" And notice how they're completely in different places, in a different order, but every time I create one of these TODOs using this format, it will get picked up in the TODO tab and you can go ahead and see where they live. So it's found two items inside our main.py. And you can see that this one is TODO: 1. This one is TODO: 2. And when you click on them they'll take you to the correct places in your code. Use this to break down the problem into smaller problems that you can solve one by one, just as you've done before, and try to see if you can complete this project. Just a word of warning. This project is quite ambitious, so give this problem at least an hour to work on it and make sure that you satisfy all the criteria that's set out in the program requirements, and also that your program works exactly the same as the final version of the Coffee Machine. Now, there are so many possible solutions to create this Coffee Machine Program, satisfying all the requirements, and the way that you code it up is essentially your choice, right? Whether if you decide to use a while loop or use a for loop or create a different data structure, there are endless possibilities. What I'm going to show you now is just one of those possibilities. And what's really important is you don't feel like you've done it wrong just because it's different to mine. As long as it works the way that you expect it to, then consider yourself successful. The first thing I'm going to do is create a new project in PyCharm, and I'm going to call my project CoffeeMachine. Again, making sure that I've got the latest version of Python as the interpreter. I'll click create. Now the first thing I'm going to do here is right click on this and create a new file, which is going to be my main.py. And then I'm going to go to my starting project in Replit, and I'm just going to copy everything there is over here and paste it into this main.py. Now you might find the font of your code or of PyCharm a little bit too big or too small. If that's the case, you can just go into preferences and change the appearance and the font to a different size, and this is for the user interface. And if you want to change the font of the Editor, then you can go here, go to font and then change that size here I've tried to make it as large as possible so that when you're looking at this video on an iPad or an iPhone, all the code should still be readable. But of course, normally when you're coding, you'd probably want to fit more lines into the same screen, but it's not good to strain your eyes, so try to strike a balance there. Now I'm going to collapse that sidebar because I'm going to be coding entirely in this one file. Now notice that at the beginning we get given a MENU, and this is a dictionary which contains three entries, and each of those entries have a name of a drink:",

      "while being able to write more and more complex projects? Well, this is where the Object-Oriented paradigm comes in really handy. Now let's imagine that you're tasked with creating the program for a self- driving car. Now, as you can imagine, this is a pretty complex project and it's many, many notches above the coffee machine that we've been struggling with so far. But what if you broke it down? What is a self-driving car? What are the different components that make up a self-driving car? Well, it probably needs some sort of camera module to keep track of what's on the road and to recognize what's on the road, it will probably need a form of lane detection to know if we're actually within the lane or if we need to turn off or if we need to park, and it will need some way of navigating so that when the user says, I want to go to the bank, they identify the branch they want to go to, and then the navigation gets set up and the car knows how to get there. And finally, you'll probably need some form of fuel management, right? What should happen when the fuel gets low? Should it go and automatically recharge at a specified point? Now I'm obviously simplifying this task. There's a lot, a lot more that goes into making an automated car. But we've already managed to break it down into several modules that we can think about tackling, right? But imagine if you have a whole team who are all working on this project and within that team, there's sub-teams who are working on each of these different modules. Well then by splitting up this big complex task into separate modules, then we can all work on this car simultaneously, massively improving our productivity, making it much quicker to eventually build all the software for this car. Plus on top of that, a lot of these modules are reusable. So if it just so happens that the next year we're tasked with building a drone, well, a lot of those programming modules that we built, like the camera module, the fuel management, the navigation, that's all going to be incredibly useful in our drone delivery software as well. And because we've taken out these individual chunks of code and modularized them using Object Oriented Programming, we won't have to code them up again in the same way that we might need to if we were using procedural programming. So what exactly is all Object Oriented Programming? We've seen that we can split a larger task into that smaller pieces. And each of those pieces can be worked on by separate teams, separate people, and also each of those pieces become reusable if we need the same functionality in the future. But Object Oriented Programming actually takes that concept even further. And I think the best way to explain it is to imagine that you are tasked with running a restaurant. So you take over this restaurant from your long lost uncle and you realize that it's actually really hard running a restaurant. So, first off, you have to be the receptionist and you reserve seats for your restaurant visitor's and then when they order something, you have to be the waitress and bring them their order. And then of course the order needs to be cooked up, right? So you're also gonna run into the kitchen and be the chef, create the thing that they ordered and finally, you're also going to be the cleaner tidying up after everybody once they've left. As you can imagine, if you were one person having to do all of these tasks, that's going to be a pretty rough day. There are in fact one-man restaurants, and I've seen some work really in well Japan, where you have one person who's taking the order, who's making the food, who's tidying up after you. But the limitation here though, is that look at how many seats he has. You can't have a large restaurant running everything by yourself. In the same way we can't create a very complex and really large software project if we are using a procedural style of programming where we're sort of running a one man band. It gets very, very complex and very hard to manage very quickly. So lets consider the alternative. What if we had just hired a bunch of people where they each have their own individual roles. They're trained for it, they know what to do. The waiter knows how to wait and the chef knows how to cook. Well, in this case, you could just be the manager and you can manage all of your staff and tell them what it is that they need to do. But then you won't have to worry about the nitty-gritty details of exactly how they need to go about doing their jobs. So for example, you don't need to tell the waiter how to wait on customers and you don't need to tell the chef how to cook an egg because they already know how to do that. And we can use the same concept to simplify the relationships in our code and make it scalable for a larger and more complex project. We've seen a little bit of why Object Oriented Programming is really useful, but now let's take a look at how you would actually go about implementing Object Oriented Programming. So in the last lesson we talked of this example of the restaurant, where we hired three types of staff, and we had a manager who would then manage all of these three different types of staff. Now, the reason why Object Oriented Programming is called that is because it's trying to model a real world object. So let's say that we are creating a virtual restaurant. Well, in this case, we probably have to model a virtual chef, waiter, cleaner, and manager. So let's say that we were going to model a waiter. In order to model our waiter, there's probably two things we need to think about: what it has and what it does. In terms of what it has, well, it might have variables like, is it holding a plate, true or false? Or which tables is it responsible for? Maybe table 4, 5 and 6. Now it also has things that it does. Maybe they're able to take an order to the chef and maybe they also need to take payments and add money to the restaurant. So these two different things, what the waiter has and what the waiter does are the two most important things that make up an object: its attributes and its methods. By looking at the code, you can pretty much see that the attributes is basically a variable. An attribute is just a fancy word for a variable that's associated with a modeled object like our waiter here. Because it's not just a free floating bit of a variable, right? It's not just somewhere in our main.py. It's actually a variable that's attached to a particular object. It's the waiter's tables responsible. Now the method goes along the same vein. These, as you can clearly see, are just functions but we call it a method because it's a function that a particular modeled object can do. We need a waiter object to take the order and we need a waiter object to take payment. Again, these are not just free-floating functions. Now, there's a lot of new words that are part of Object Oriented Programming and programming in general, we're going to see them again and again, and eventually it's going to become a word that's going to be in your dictionary. But for now, just remember that in Object Oriented Programming, we're trying to model real-life objects and those objects have things and they also can do things. The things that they have are their attributes and these are usually modeled with variables, and the things that they can do are called methods and they are modeled by functions. So essentially, an object is just a way of combining some piece of data and some functionality altogether in the same thing. But we can actually have multiple objects generated from the same type. So when we've modeled a particular job in our virtual restaurant like the waiter's job, and we figured out what are the things that the waiter have and what are the things that it can do, well, we can actually generate multiple versions of the same object. So we could have Henry who's a waiter and we can also have Betty who's a waiter, and we can generate as many of these as we want from the same blueprint. And in OOP we call this blueprint, or this type, a class. And we call these individual objects that are generated from the blueprint an object. So now let's take a look at how you use these class blueprints to create an actual object. [inaudible] So here's a blueprint for a car. And that blueprint that specifies what the color of the car is, how many wheels it should have, what its mileage is, how much fuel it has, all of those bits of data combined with all of its functionality like the ability to drive, the ability to stop and break. And that blueprint which models a real-life car is known as the class. And it's from this blueprint, this class, that we can generate as many objects as we want. Now, the object is the actual thing that we're going to be using in our code. The code equivalent of what just happened, creating a new object from a blueprint, looks like this in Python. You have the class which is normally written with the first letter of each word capitalized, which is known as Pascal case. This is to differentiate it from all the variable and function names that we give in Python, where each word is separated by underscores. So in this case, the car is the object and it gets created from this car blueprint. All we have to do to create the object from the class is to give the object a name, it can be anything you want, set it equal to the name of the class, and then the parentheses, which in the same way as it activates the function, it activates the construction of this object from the blueprint. Now, in order for us to practice this and to see it in action, we're going to using a library of code that somebody else has created. And what it allows us to do is to finally start putting graphics onto the screen. The premise is really simple. Let's say that somebody somewhere has created a blueprint for a turtle. Now this turtle has a paintbrush on its back, and you can tell the turtle to dip the paintbrush in different colors, pick a different of size paint brushes and most importantly, you can tell it to draw onto the screen. This library is called turtle graphics and it's preloaded with every download of Python so we can get started with it straight away. So go ahead and open up PyCharm and create a new project. Now I'm going to call mine, buy the old convention day 16 start and making sure that I'm on the latest version of Python in my base interpreter, I'm going to click create. Now, once you've created the new project, go ahead and create the main.py as we have always done. In our case, we're going to be creating an object from a blueprint that somebody else has already created, and the blueprint lives in another module called turtle. So we'll have to import that module. And we know that from previously, we can import other modules and use the things that are declared inside the module by importing it, and then tapping into various things in there. So for example, if I was to go and create another new file which I'll call another_module. Now inside another_module, let's say I create another variable. And now I can go back to my main.py, I can import my another_module I just created and I can tap into that variable that's inside another module by saying another module dot another variable. Now let's go ahead and run this code as it is. And you can see the value of that variable from the other module being used inside our main.py. Now I want to do the same thing using turtle, but in this case, I want to tap into the class called turtle that's declared inside this turtle module. The wording's a little bit confusing, but let me show you what I mean. So I'm going to tap into the turtle module and I'm going to get hold of a turtle class. So notice how it's got the C here denoting that this is a blueprint for creating a new turtle object. Now, remember that to actually construct the object we need to add the parentheses at the end, and now we can save all of this into an actual object, which we get to name. So I'm going to call my turtle timmy and now I've got a new turtle object. Essentially, we've done the same thing as we have done up here. We've imported a module called turtle, we've tapped into that turtle module here, and then we've fetched something from that module. In this case, it's a variable. And in this case, it's a class which is denoted by the capital T, the Pascal case here. And then we've used the parentheses to initialize or basically construct an object from that blueprint and we've saved it into an object called Timmy. Now I can simplify this code to make it look more like what we had in the slides by saying, instead of import turtle, I can say from, from the turtle module import the turtle class. So now, instead of writing all of this, I can simply just write Timmy equals a new object created from the turtle class and it's constructed. This is how we would construct our new object. So now I have this brand new object called Timmy and if I go ahead and print timmy you can see that when I run this code what gets printed is a new turtle object from the turtle module and it's saved at this location in the computer's memory. So this is very different from say if we just printed a string or a number. It works completely differently. In this case, it's actually a object that's being printed. Now, what can we do with this object? [inaudible] Now, as we saw before with our car object it has certain attributes, right? Like speed and fuel, data that it could keep track of that are really important to the modeling of an actual car object. Now, when it comes to accessing these attributes, the syntax or the code looks like this. Car in this case is the object and then we use a dot or a full stop to separate the object from the actual attribute that we want to get hold of, which in this case is speed. What this code does is it essentially identifies the object and then it says, from this object get the speed attribute. This is actually gonna represent the speed of this particular car object. Coming back to our turtle. One of the other classes that is inside this turtle module is something called screen. And the screen represents the window in which this turtle is going to show up. So let's go ahead and create this screen object. I'm going to call my object my_screen and then I'm going to create it from this blueprint of a screen that we imported. Now we can tap into one of the screens properties which is called the canvas height and canvas width. So let's see what the height is, and notice how we're using that dot notation. So this is the object and then separated by a dot we've got the attributes that we want to access from this object. So I'm going to print that into the console. Now, when I go ahead and run this code, you'll see a window pop up very briefly and that was the screen on which our turtle is going to show up. Now, if you take a look in the console, you can see that not only have we printed the turtle object, but we've also printed the height of the canvas for this particular screen that we've created. So the screen here is the object and that canvas height is an attribute that's associated with that screen. Now, in addition to the things that an object has, so data that it holds like the speed or the fuel which we've already seen, it also has things that it can do, right? So functions that are associated with that particular object. And these functions when it's tied to an object is known as a method. But essentially we would use it the same way as we have done with any other function that we've created so far. The only difference is the syntax. Firstly, we would tap into the car object and then using that same dot notation that we saw with the attributes, we're saying car.stop. So essentially what we're doing is we're getting hold of the object and then we're calling this function that's associated with that object, which is known as a method. So coming back to our code here, one of the things that we can do with this screen object that we've created here called my_screen is we can tap into one of its functions. And because it's a function that's tied to an object, it's actually called a method. So the method name is called exitonclick. And what this will allow us to do is instead of having our screen show up and then quickly disappear when our code ends, this exitonclick will allow our program to continue running until we click on the screen and then it exits our code. So let's try this again and notice how we've now got our screen show up and this canvas has a height of 300 and a width of 300, but now we can see our turtle in the form of the arrow. So this is our a little Timmy shown up in the middle. And our code is only going to exit when the screen detects a click because we've called this function that's associated with the screen object. So now if I click on the screen, you can see process finished with exit code zero, our code is ended and the screen has disappeared. Now there are other functions as well. So if we take our little timmy object and we say, well, timmy, why don't we change the shape of you on the screen and we'll change you into an actual turtle? So now when I run the code, you can see that object in the center is now in the shape of a turtle. Now, if you want to know how I know about all these things I can do with the turtle graphics library, then of course, I'm getting all of this information from the documentation. So in the course resources, you'll see a link to this Turtle graphics documentation, and it tells you all the things that you can do with your turtle. So for example, you can call all of these methods that are associated with your turtle object to get your turtle to move and draw, and you can also use it to change its position or change its coordinates, as well as doing things like changing the color or resetting. And you can browse through this list to see how you would use each of these things. So for example, if I wanted to change the color of my turtle, I can do that by simply just calling this method, color, and then inside the parentheses I pass in the argument of the actual color string. Now you can choose from a whole range of colors just by putting in the name as a string into that method which is called color. So go ahead and see if you can change our turtle timmy's color from the default which is just black to one of the colors that you see in this link here, and the link, of course, is in the course resources. So let's say I want to change it to a coral color like this one. All I have to do is tap into my object which is called timmy, and then call the method which is called color onto it. And you can see all the methods are denoted by a little M here in the circle. Now this color, of course, expects some sort of input. So the input that it expects is a actual string of a color. And my string is going to be coral, which I picked up from here. So now let's run our code and see what it looks like now. Once the screen refreshes, you can see that our turtle is now a nice coral color, and we've managed to do all of this to change the shape, change the color, all because we were able to call these functions which belong to this object. Now see if you can use the documentation here and figure out how to get the turtle to move forward by a hundred paces. Pause the video and try to complete this challenge. All right. So we saw earlier that it has a whole bunch of move and draw methods. So we can simply use this forward method to get it to move forward. And in terms of the parameters that it takes, it takes a number which is going to determine the distance that it's going to move forward by. So we said that we wanted our turtle to move forward by a hundred paces. All I have to do is specify the object that I want to move which is timmy, and then call that method forward and pass in the distance. So I said a hundred paces. So now let's run our code again, and you can see that little turtle just move forward by a hundred paces. So now we've seen how to create a new Object from a blueprint, we've seen how we can tap into its attributes by using the object name dot and then the name of the attribute. So this is the same as having a variable that's associated with that object. And finally, we've seen how we can call methods that are associated with the object. For example, here when we changed the shape or when we changed the color or when we told it to go forwards. Now in the next lesson, I'm going to show you how you can get hold of more external libraries not just turtle, but a whole world of packages that you can tap into. And you can start using these packages of code that other programmers have already developed, and simply by creating objects from the existing blueprints and reading the documentation to get it to do various things that you want it to. So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson. Now, I've mentioned a lot about using code that other developers have written, and the most common way to do this is through using packages of code. In this lesson, I'll show you how to integrate an existing package of code into our project so that we can practice creating objects and working with attributes and methods. Now we've seen modules of code where each file that we create in our project is essentially a module in itself, but a package differs from a module in the sense that it's actually a whole bunch of code that other people have written. Lots and lots of files, all packaged together to achieve some sort of goal or purpose. Now, let's say that we want to create a table of Pokemon and their type, so we wanted some way of documenting that Pikachu is an Electric type, and maybe Squirtle is a Water type. Now, if we wanted to do that in ASCII so that we could print it in the console, well, then we would have to go about formatting it, and it'll be quite painful. So we might have to print some sort of pipe, and then maybe we would have the name of the field, so Pokemon name, and then maybe another pipe, and then we would have the name of the next column, which is their type. And then finally we would close that off, and then we would have to print some sort of horizontal line maybe like this, and so on and so forth, just to create this table. And it's quite difficult if you're not used to manipulating ASCII and visualizing it. I certainly am not up to this task. So what could we do instead? Well, we could search for a Package that other developers have created to achieve this goal, and the place that we would do that is somewhere called PyPI, which is the Python Package Index. And this is a bunch of software for the Python programming language that is developed and shared by the Python community. So we can see their source code, but more importantly, we can see how to implement the code and how to put it into our project. In here, I'm going to search for something called, prettytable. And this is a very simple library that is going to help us to display tables in an ASCII format. We can click on the project links to find out more about it, and this will take us to the Google Code Archive where the documentation is hosted. If you go to Wikis and go to tutorial, you'll see some documentation on how to use it. Now, this particular package is not as extensive as the Turtle graphics package, so there's actually not a lot of things you can do with it, but it's got more than we need for our use case. The first thing we have to do is to install this package into our project. Now, unlike the Turtle package, which is already pre-loaded with every copy of Python, in order to use the packages that you find in the Python Package Index, you actually have to install it. So here's how we do it in PyCharm. First go to the Preferences, so in windows I think it's under File, and then Preferences. On Mac, it's under PyCharm and then Preferences. And then here you'll see a whole bunch of things you can change including the Editor or Appearance, which we've already messed around with. But I want you to click on your project. So my project is called day-16-start. And then we're going to go into the project interpreter. And here we can click on the plus button to install any package that you find in the Python Package Index. Make a note of what it's called, so ours is called PrettyTable. And then we're going to search for it inside the available packages, and once we found it we're going to select it, and then click install. So now it's installed successfully, we can go ahead and close this down, and click Okay. And we can now access this package called PrettyTable in our code. Again I'm going to import it so I can say, import prettytable. And now I can use everything that's inside this package. Now if you want to see the source code you can actually right-click on it and select go to implementation. And this will take you to the Python file where this entire Pretty Table is implemented. So all of the code that they've written. It's a little bit daunting, and it's got a lot of code in it, but we don't have to worry about how the code is created and how it works. All we need to do is look at the documentation for this package and see how we can implement it into our project. Now, in the next lesson, we're going to get some practice constructing a PrettyTable object and, using the documentation to explore this object's attributes and methods. For all of that and more, I'll see you there. In the last lesson, we added an external library to our project. Now it's time to construct a prettytable object and practice using its methods and attributes. Our starting point as always is the documentation. Here you can see how to construct an actual prettytable object. So let's use what we've learned previously about constructing objects to go ahead and create this object from the class. Now, firstly, we're going to do the same thing as we did previously with turtle. We're going to tap into the package prettytable, and then we're going to import the prettytable class noted by the c here. Now that we have access to this class inside our code, I want you to go ahead and create an object from this pretty table class and the object should be named table. So pause the video and give that a go. All right. So we said I'll object is going to be called table, and then we're going to construct it from this class called a prettytable. So we're going to put it in with its casing. So this is the Pascal case that we spoke about earlier on, and then in order to actually give it the go-ahead and construct, we have to add the parentheses at the end. So now you've created a new object called table from this prettytable and we can actually go ahead and print this table. And even at this stage, it's ready going to start printing out a bare bones version all the table. But of course this table has no datas So it's actually kind of hard to visualize what all of these ASCII characters are doing in an empty table. But no matter, the next thing we can see in our documentation is how to go about adding columns. So it's got this method, remember methods are functions that are associated with an object and this method will add columns to whatever table we specify. Now the method takes two inputs. One is the name of the field, so our field names are Pokemon name and type. And then we've got a list of strings which is going to be the data that's going to go into that column. Essentially, every time we call that method, add column, it's going to allow us to give a field name as a string, and then a list of data in order that they're going to go into the table. So we're going to add our table one column at a time. Using that documentation see if you can add both of these columns to our table object and then once you've done that, we're going to print the table object again and we should be to see an ASCII table. This is what you're aiming for when you run your code. It should print out your table and nicely format it in this ASCII style. Pause the video and complete the challenge. Right? All right. So we've got our table object and remember that methods are functions that are associated with the object. So we say table object dot, and then we get to call that method, add_column. And notice how it takes two inputs, the field name and the data that's going to go into the column. So the field name is going to be a string, and this is going to be the name at the top of our column. So in our case, it was called Pokemon name. And then after a comma, we get to put in a list of all the data that's going to go into our column. So just as a quick reminder, our first column contains Pikachu, Squirtle and Charmander. Now, we should have added a column to our table and you can safely ignore all of these typos because of course, Pokemon names are not real words. But if you wanted to check against the poke dex you can actually go to this link in the course resources, and you can see how each of these Pokemon are spelt. Now, the next thing we want to add is the associated type with each of these Pokemons. So for example, Charmander is a fire type of Pokemon, Squirtle is a water type Pokemon, but essentially we're going to add the data that's in the second column. So the field name is called type, and then we've got three pieces of data that's going to need to go into the list in the same order as the previous Pokemon. That way we'll actually match them up properly. So if you haven't already, go ahead and add the second column. Right? So again, I'm going to call the same method on my table and this time I'm going to add the field type and the data is going to go in the order of the data that I had from the previous column. So the first one is the type of Pikachu which is electric. And the second one is the type for Squirtle, which is Water. And finally, we've got fire for Charmander. So now this will be matched to this, this will be matched this and so on and so forth. If we go ahead and print our table now, so if we run our code and take a look in here, you can see how we've now got a nicely formatted table by creating an object from this pre-made prettytable class and we've now called this method add_column to add two columns. And when we print our table, it's now nicely formatted in ASCII. Now, remember that we can also change the object's attributes. For example, if we wanted to change the appearance of our table, that's probably controlled by an attribute. If you scroll down, you can see that we can change the table style by tapping into each of these attributes. For example, if I wanted to change the alignment of my data in the table, I can change this align attribute to L for left-align, C for the center-align or R for right-aligned. Do you remember how to tap into an object's attribute? If you do, go ahead and see if you can change our table from center-aligned by default to left-aligned. Pause the video and try to complete that challenge. Right? So again, we're going to tap into our table object and we're going to use the dot notation, but this time instead of accessing a method associated with the object which is of course denoted by the M, we're going to access an attribute or in this case, they've titled F which is a field. And the one that we want is this align. So let's go ahead and type align, and now we have access to this attribute. Let's see what happens if I go ahead and print this align attribute. You can see that for both of my columns, Pokemon name and type, the align attribute is set to C, which is centered. What I want to do is change the whole table to be left-aligned. Just as we would with any other variable we can of course print it, but we can also change it. And we would change a variable by just using the equal sign, right? So let's change the alignment to left-aligned, and now let's run the code again. And you can see now both of my columns are now aligning with the left hand margin. So we've seen how we can use attributes like the ones here to change the styling of our table. We've seen how we can use methods like add_column or add_row to work with this table object and get it to perform some sort of functionality, like adding pieces of data to it. And we've seen how we can create new objects by simply constructing it from the blueprint class. Feel free to mess around with prettytable as much as you like change, other things about it, or add different pieces of data. But once you're happy with creating the object changing the attributes and calling the methods, then head over to the next lesson where I've got a quiz for you. Now as we start using objects and their attributes and methods, more and more, we're going to start to see why it is that they are so useful and so loved by programmers. Now, I think one of the non-programmers that explained OOP the best is actually the late Steve Jobs, and he has this brilliant example that makes it really clear why objects are so great. In his story, he talks about this concept where let's say you were traveling to Japan, and after a long flight, you finally land and you go outside and there's beautiful cherry blossoms, Mount Fuji is looking wonderful, but unfortunately, on the flight you had soiled your T-shirt. You were overly eager with the tomato juice and you spilled everything on yourself. So what do we do? Well, you're in this unfamiliar city, and you have no idea even where the hell you are, let alone where to find the nearest dry cleaners or launderette. And plus, on top of that, you don't have the local currency, they take Yen, but you only have pounds, and you don't even speak Japanese. So what do you do? It's going to be a real struggle trying to solve this problem. Well, you're staying at a hotel, right? And the hotel staff probably speak English. So you go to the receptionist and you tell the hotel that, hey, my T-shirt is soiled. And they say, \"Hey, no problems, we'll take that from you and we'll go and handle all of that messy stuff. We know how to find the dry cleaners, we can pay them in the local currency and we speak the local language.\" And what you get back is just a nice clean T-shirt. So this is similar to the process of working with objects. Essentially, if you have this Hotel object which has a blueprint for how to handle drycleaning, some sort of clothing, then all you have to do is just get the object, hotel, and then call its associated method dry_clean, and then it will do all of the messy stuff for you. And you don't have to worry about the implementation of this function at all. So now you can work with multiple objects, getting them to do different things and trust that they know how to manage their data and how to perform the necessary functionality. Coming back to a problem that we've already solved, creating that coffee machine with all of the program requirements, well, it's time to put our Object Oriented Programming knowledge to the test, because we're going to be making a OOP version of our coffee machine. Now, the program still has the same requirements as before, you have to print reports for all the resources, you have to check the resources are sufficient, process coins, check transaction is successful, and finally make coffee. But in this case, you're going to be working with objects in the Course Resources, you'll find a link to the starting project for the OOP Coffee Machine. So if you head over to this link, you can see that there's a whole bunch of code that we've already written for you. Now, the idea here is you're not going to touch any of these other files, the money_machine, the menu, or the coffee_maker. All of that code has already been written for you, and it's almost like you're working with an external library. You're just going to trust that they do what they say they do. And you'll find a link to this Coffee Machine Documentation that I've created, which describes in detail what each of these Classes or Blueprints allow you to do. So once you construct an object from the MenuItem Class, then you have access to the name attribute, the cost attribute, ingredient attribute, and there's also descriptions of what it should do and what an example might be. You have access to all of these classes, and you can build objects from each of these classes to solve this project. In order to work with PyCharm, all you need to do is to download the zip file with all the starting code from our Course Resource website. Alternatively...Now once you found that in your downloads folder, all you have to do is uncompress or unzip it, and then you can go into PyCharm and open it here. So click on the Open button, and then navigate to where you had that folder downloaded. Remember it needs to be unzipped. If you're on Windows, right-click the zip file, and choose Extract All, then click Extract. You should see an unzipped folder pop up next to your zip file. If you're on Mac, then all you need to do is just double-click on the .zip file. Now if we click Open on that folder, then it will open up this project, and when you open up the Project folder, you'll see all of the same files. Now you're only going to be working from the main.py. In fact, I don't even want you to care that much about the code that's in the other files. It has class definitions and a whole bunch of other things that we're going to learn about in the next lesson. But for now, I want you to treat it as if it is an external library, which you're just going to use. At the very beginning of the main.py file, I've already imported all four classes that you're going to be using Menu, MenuItem, CoffeeMaker, and MoneyMachine. Now all of these classes are documented in the Coffee Machine Documentation website. All you have to do is head over to this website and read through what each of the classes do. Some of them have attributes and methods, others just have methods. So each of these classes have already pre-written code that do a lot of the heavy lifting, and all of the code that we had to write when we wrote the coffee machine code from scratch. But this time you're only going to be using these four classes and the objects created from them in order to achieve exactly the same goals as before. So while the goals are fresh in your mind from the previous day, you should review the code from the previous day and then have a read of the documentation and see how you would implement exactly the same project, but this time using only the objects created from these classes. You'll need to spend some time on this because you'll need to think through how to create objects from these blueprint classes, and then how to use the objects, how to call the methods and the logic that's required to put everything together. Pause the video now, have a think about this problem, and try to make the Coffee Machine do exactly the same, and have all the same functionality as the coffee machine that you created in yesterday's project. If you got stuck or if you had any problems completing this project, the first port of call is to review the lessons you learned today. It might just be that you need to see some of the theory a few more times and listen to it a few more times and practice it a few more times before you're ready to tackle this final challenge. But if you have completed it and you just want to see the solution, then I'm going to go through it with you right now. Again, we're going to complete all of the program requirements step by step. So the first thing is to print a report for all of the current resources in the coffee machine. Back in PyCharm, I'm actually going to collapse this entire project folder because I'm not going to be writing any code other than inside main.py. Now you can see up here, we've got access to four classes. And if we take a look inside the documentation, you can see that both the coffeemaker class and the money machine class have a method called report. And this is going to print a report of all of the resources like water, milk, coffee, and this is going to print a report of the current profit. So our final report is going to be both a report from the money machine as well as the coffee maker. Let's go ahead and start off by creating some objects from these classes. For example, the money machine is going to be just called money_machine or you could call it my_money_machine. You can actually name your objects anything you like. But I'm just going to use the default Python snake case to create a new variable money_machine, which is going to hold my object. And my object is going to be created, of course, from the money machine class. And the construction happens when I add the parentheses. So now I have a object created and stored inside this variable money_machine. Now, if I want this money machine to create a report, then all I have to do is tap into the object and then write a dot and then call the method that I need, which is report. So now if I go ahead and run my code, you can see it prints out the current amount of money in the machine. Now let's do the same thing for our coffee maker. Again, I'm going to call it coffee_maker, and you see this frequently. The object naming tends to be the lower case and snake case, so separated by underscores, version of the name of the class. So the name of the class is CoffeeMaker, and usually you'll see people name the object exactly the same, but in lowercase. And now that I have my coffee _maker, then I can go ahead and call the report method on that object as well. And now, if I run my code once more, you can see that I've got everything now being reported and printed out. So in this case, we don't actually have to care how report is implementing all of this functionality. All we have to do is read the documentation, find the method that does the thing that we want, and then trust that it will carry out the functionality as described. Now that we've completed step 1, the next one is to check that resources are sufficient. My first port of call is going to be going over to the documentation. And you can see that the coffeemaker class actually has a method called is _resource_efficient. And all we have to do is pass in the drink, which is a menu item, and then it's going to check and give us true, if that drink order can be made, and false if the ingredients are insufficient. So how do we get hold of this drink menu item to pass over to this method? Well, if we take a look at the menu class, you can see it has a method called get_items and this is where you really see reading the documentation properly, actually absorbing everything that's in here becomes really, really helpful. This menu class has two methods that are really useful. One, It's able to get a hold of the names of all the items that are available on the menu. And it returns it as a string separated by forward slashes. It's also able to find a drink based on the order name. So if we passed in one of these names to this function find_drink, then it's going to return a menu item object if it actually exists. Otherwise, it's going to return none. We're going to need both of these in order to ask the user what they want. Let's go ahead and set up our while loop. As we had previously I'm going to create a new variable called is_on and it's going to start off being true. And then while coffee machine is on, well then we're going to get hold of all the options that we can offer the user. And we get that by calling that method get_items. But of course, because this is a method, it's associated with an object. So we have to create an object from this menu blueprint. So let's do that next to all the other objects being created. So let's create a menu object and it's going to be created from the menu class, and then we add the parentheses. And now we have access to that object by the name menu. The options are going to be equal to the menu object and then we're going to call the get_items method. And then when this method returns, it's going to save the string and all the options into this variable called options. Now we can get the user's choice by asking them for what would you like? And then inside a set of parenthesis we'll offer them all the options. And then, of course, I need to turn this into an fstring. And the code highlighting immediately tells me that this is actually now working. So once I've got the user's choice, then I can incorporate the reporting behaviour into this choice. Remember, previously we said if the choice was equal to off, then that means the is_on is going to be equal to false, and elif the choice is equal to report, well, in this case, we're going to get the coffeemaker and the money machine to make their reports into the console. Finally, we're ready to tackle the next problem, which is how do we check that we have enough resources? And this is going to require us to find the drink given the order name that the user chose from the choice and then get hold of the menu item which comes as the output from this method call. So else, we're going to save our drink as a variable called drink, and then we're going to tap into the menu.find_drink. And find_drink, you'll notice, takes a order name as the input. So this is a string and this is going to be equal to whatever the user chose inside this choice. So let's put the choice in here as the input. And now, once we've got hold of this drink, let's go ahead and print it. Remember, we're expecting a menu item object at this stage. So let's click run, and let's make sure that we can hit report to get the report, we can say off to switch off the machine and exit the code, and we can also get hold of a latte by passing in latte as the drink that we want. And we now get printed a menu item object at this particular location in the computer's memory. Perfect. Everything is working as expected. Now, instead of printing the drink, I'm going to tackle this step 2, which is to check that the resources are sufficient. Again, that's going to require us to look through our documentation. And you'll see that the coffee maker class has that method is_resource _sufficient, and it expects a menu item object as the input. And then it's going to return true when it can be made and false if it can't. So let's get hold of our coffee maker object and then get it to check if the resources are sufficient to make the current drink that we're interested in. And let's go ahead and print the results here and run our code. Let's say that we wanted to make a latte. That's going to be resource sufficient, so true. Espresso, also true, and a Cappuccino is also true. So we can make all three drinks, basically. Now, instead of printing this, what we want to do is we want to check if this is true and then proceed to the next step if there are enough resources. Now the next step is to take payment from the user and to process the coins and check the transaction is successful. Notice how in our coffee machine documentation for the money machine, we don't actually have a way of processing the coins. But it what it does have is it allows us to make payments passing in the cost of the drink and then it will return true when the payment is accepted or false, if insufficient. So let's see what happens if we actually try to make payment. Let's tap into our money machine object and then call the make_payment method and we have to pass in the cost of the drink that the user ordered. So we've got the drink object here, which remember is a menu item, and each of the menu items have three attributes that we care about: the name of the drink, the cost of the drink and the ingredient list. So this is what we're interested in at the moment. So we can pass in the drink.cost which is the attribute that's associated with the drink object, and that cost is going to be processed by this make_payment method from the money machine. And then finally, it's going to tell us whether if this was successful or not. So let's see what happens when we run this code as it is. Let's say I wanted a latte, notice how it's asking me to insert coins: how many quarters, how many dimes, how many nickels and how many pennies. A the coffee machine, I don't actually need to care about how the money and the coins are processed. All I had to do is call make_payment and it deals with all of this automatically. Finally, it gives me the change and it returns true, telling me that this make_payment was indeed successful. If you actually look inside the money_machine code, then you can see that it has a method called process_ coins, but it's called when make payment is triggered. This class is going to process coins, and then it's going to decide whether if it was successful or not. And if it was successful, it's going to add the cost to the profit, and if not, it's going to tell you that that was not enough money and your money is refunded. Coming back over here, if this is successful, then that means the user has managed to pay and we fulfilled step 3 and 4 just using one method. The final thing we have to do is to actually make the coffee. And that, of course, happens right at the end here. And all we have to do to make the coffee is get hold of the coffee maker object and then call the make_ coffee method and we can pass in the order, which is our drink. Because remember that the make_coffee method expects a menu item as the input parameter. We can actually simplify this code even more by saying, well, if the coffee maker is_resource_sufficient and the money machine was able to take payment, well then we can get the coffee_maker to make coffee. So now let's go ahead and run our code. And let's report to begin with, to see how much resources we have to begin with. And then let's order a coffee. Insert lots of money and we've got our coffee back. So now let's go ahead and order a different coffee, latte, and let's go ahead and insert lots of money. And you can see, here's my latte. But now, if I hit report, you can see that the objects, the coffee maker has been managing our resources and the money_machine has been managing our profit. Now, if I decided to order another latte, then it should actually tell me, sorry, there's not enough water and there's not enough milk. So it can't make me that drink. And we've managed to achieve all of this functionality by writing very few lines of code, and the code itself is actually very, very easy to understand. Even if you came to this completely fresh, you've never seen how each of the methods are implemented, you don't know how the coffee maker works, you don't know how the money machine works, you can see quite easily what it's trying to do. And so if you only have to write this kind of code, then it would make it so much easier to create even more complex functionality in your coffee machine, right? So have a play around with these classes:",
      "if you think back to yesterday's project, some of you I'm sure at some point during the project, would have had this feeling of what on earth is going on with my code? And the reason is because our code is getting more complex, it's trying to do a lot of things, and it's trying to manage a whole bunch of relationships. So one function is changing a variable, and then that same function is doing something else to another variable. And at some point, the logic of our code starts looking very, very spaghetti- like. And it's at this point where it's really hard to track and remember what's actually going on in our code. So this style of programming is called Procedural Programming where we set up procedures or functions that do particular things. And then one procedure leads to another procedure, and all in all, the computer's mostly working from top to bottom and then jumping out into a function as needed. Procedural programming is one of the earliest paradigms of Programming. In fact, back in the days when we had older languages like Fortran and COBOL, they rely pretty much exclusively on procedural programming like what we've been doing. But the increase in complexity, the increase in the number of relationships that we need to remember and manage starts making it look a bit like the dating history of the Kardashians. And it gets very, very confusing because everybody has been in touch with somebody else. Now, the kind of relationships I prefer are one to one, me and my couch. So how can we maintain a simple relationship in our code while being able to write more and more complex projects? Well, this is where the Object-Oriented paradigm comes in really handy. Now let's imagine that you're tasked with creating the program for a self- driving car. Now, as you can imagine, this is a pretty complex project and it's many, many notches above the coffee machine that we've been struggling with so far. But what if you broke it down? What is a self-driving car? What are the different components that make up a self-driving car? Well, it probably needs some sort of camera module to keep track of what's on the road and to recognize what's on the road, it will probably need a form of lane detection to know if we're actually within the lane or if we need to turn off or if we need to park, and it will need some way of navigating so that when the user says, I want to go to the bank, they identify the branch they want to go to, and then the navigation gets set up and the car knows how to get there. And finally, you'll probably need some form of fuel management, right? What should happen when the fuel gets low? Should it go and automatically recharge at a specified point? Now I'm obviously simplifying this task. There's a lot, a lot more that goes into making an automated car. But we've already managed to break it down into several modules that we can think about tackling, right? But imagine if you have a whole team who are all working on this project and within that team, there's sub-teams who are working on each of these different modules. Well then by splitting up this big complex task into separate modules, then we can all work on this car simultaneously, massively improving our productivity, making it much quicker to eventually build all the software for this car. Plus on top of that, a lot of these modules are reusable. So if it just so happens that the next year we're tasked with building a drone, well, a lot of those programming modules that we built, like the camera module, the fuel management, the navigation, that's all going to be incredibly useful in our drone delivery software as well. And because we've taken out these individual chunks of code and modularized them using Object Oriented Programming, we won't have to code them up again in the same way that we might need to if we were using procedural programming. So what exactly is all Object Oriented Programming? We've seen that we can split a larger task into that smaller pieces. And each of those pieces can be worked on by separate teams, separate people, and also each of those pieces become reusable if we need the same functionality in the future. But Object Oriented Programming actually takes that concept even further. And I think the best way to explain it is to imagine that you are tasked with running a restaurant. So you take over this restaurant from your long lost uncle and you realize that it's actually really hard running a restaurant. So, first off, you have to be the receptionist and you reserve seats for your restaurant visitor's and then when they order something, you have to be the waitress and bring them their order. And then of course the order needs to be cooked up, right? So you're also gonna run into the kitchen and be the chef, create the thing that they ordered and finally, you're also going to be the cleaner tidying up after everybody once they've left. As you can imagine, if you were one person having to do all of these tasks, that's going to be a pretty rough day. There are in fact one-man restaurants, and I've seen some work really in well Japan, where you have one person who's taking the order, who's making the food, who's tidying up after you. But the limitation here though, is that look at how many seats he has. You can't have a large restaurant running everything by yourself. In the same way we can't create a very complex and really large software project if we are using a procedural style of programming where we're sort of running a one man band. It gets very, very complex and very hard to manage very quickly. So lets consider the alternative. What if we had just hired a bunch of people where they each have their own individual roles. They're trained for it, they know what to do. The waiter knows how to wait and the chef knows how to cook. Well, in this case, you could just be the manager and you can manage all of your staff and tell them what it is that they need to do. But then you won't have to worry about the nitty-gritty details of exactly how they need to go about doing their jobs. So for example, you don't need to tell the waiter how to wait on customers and you don't need to tell the chef how to cook an egg because they already know how to do that. And we can use the same concept to simplify the relationships in our code and make it scalable for a larger and more complex project. We've seen a little bit of why Object Oriented Programming is really useful, but now let's take a look at how you would actually go about implementing Object Oriented Programming. So in the last lesson we talked of this example of the restaurant, where we hired three types of staff, and we had a manager who would then manage all of these three different types of staff. Now, the reason why Object Oriented Programming is called that is because it's trying to model a real world object. So let's say that we are creating a virtual restaurant. Well, in this case, we probably have to model a virtual chef, waiter, cleaner, and manager. So let's say that we were going to model a waiter. In order to model our waiter, there's probably two things we need to think about: what it has and what it does. In terms of what it has, well, it might have variables like, is it holding a plate, true or false? Or which tables is it responsible for? Maybe table 4, 5 and 6. Now it also has things that it does. Maybe they're able to take an order to the chef and maybe they also need to take payments and add money to the restaurant. So these two different things, what the waiter has and what the waiter does are the two most important things that make up an object: its attributes and its methods. By looking at the code, you can pretty much see that the attributes is basically a variable. An attribute is just a fancy word for a variable that's associated with a modeled object like our waiter here. Because it's not just a free floating bit of a variable, right? It's not just somewhere in our main.py. It's actually a variable that's attached to a particular object. It's the waiter's tables responsible. Now the method goes along the same vein. These, as you can clearly see, are just functions but we call it a method because it's a function that a particular modeled object can do. We need a waiter object to take the order and we need a waiter object to take payment. Again, these are not just free-floating functions. Now, there's a lot of new words that are part of Object Oriented Programming and programming in general, we're going to see them again and again, and eventually it's going to become a word that's going to be in your dictionary. But for now, just remember that in Object Oriented Programming, we're trying to model real-life objects and those objects have things and they also can do things. The things that they have are their attributes and these are usually modeled with variables, and the things that they can do are called methods and they are modeled by functions. So essentially, an object is just a way of combining some piece of data and some functionality altogether in the same thing. But we can actually have multiple objects generated from the same type. So when we've modeled a particular job in our virtual restaurant like the waiter's job, and we figured out what are the things that the waiter have and what are the things that it can do, well, we can actually generate multiple versions of the same object. So we could have Henry who's a waiter and we can also have Betty who's a waiter, and we can generate as many of these as we want from the same blueprint. And in OOP we call this blueprint, or this type, a class. And we call these individual objects that are generated from the blueprint an object. So now let's take a look at how you use these class blueprints to create an actual object. [inaudible] So here's a blueprint for a car. And that blueprint that specifies what the color of the car is, how many wheels it should have, what its mileage is, how much fuel it has, all of those bits of data combined with all of its functionality like the ability to drive, the ability to stop and break. And that blueprint which models a real-life car is known as the class. And it's from this blueprint, this class, that we can generate as many objects as we want. Now, the object is the actual thing that we're going to be using in our code. The code equivalent of what just happened, creating a new object from a blueprint, looks like this in Python. You have the class which is normally written with the first letter of each word capitalized, which is known as Pascal case. This is to differentiate it from all the variable and function names that we give in Python, where each word is separated by underscores. So in this case, the car is the object and it gets created from this car blueprint. All we have to do to create the object from the class is to give the object a name, it can be anything you want, set it equal to the name of the class, and then the parentheses, which in the same way as it activates the function, it activates the construction of this object from the blueprint. Now, in order for us to practice this and to see it in action, we're going to using a library of code that somebody else has created. And what it allows us to do is to finally start putting graphics onto the screen. The premise is really simple. Let's say that somebody somewhere has created a blueprint for a turtle. Now this turtle has a paintbrush on its back, and you can tell the turtle to dip the paintbrush in different colors, pick a different of size paint brushes and most importantly, you can tell it to draw onto the screen. This library is called turtle graphics and it's preloaded with every download of Python so we can get started with it straight away. So go ahead and open up PyCharm and create a new project. Now I'm going to call mine, buy the old convention day 16 start and making sure that I'm on the latest version of Python in my base interpreter, I'm going to click create. Now, once you've created the new project, go ahead and create the main.py as we have always done. In our case, we're going to be creating an object from a blueprint that somebody else has already created, and the blueprint lives in another module called turtle. So we'll have to import that module. And we know that from previously, we can import other modules and use the things that are declared inside the module by importing it, and then tapping into various things in there. So for example, if I was to go and create another new file which I'll call another_module. Now inside another_module, let's say I create another variable. And now I can go back to my main.py, I can import my another_module I just created and I can tap into that variable that's inside another module by saying another module dot another variable. Now let's go ahead and run this code as it is. And you can see the value of that variable from the other module being used inside our main.py. Now I want to do the same thing using turtle, but in this case, I want to tap into the class called turtle that's declared inside this turtle module. The wording's a little bit confusing, but let me show you what I mean. So I'm going to tap into the turtle module and I'm going to get hold of a turtle class. So notice how it's got the C here denoting that this is a blueprint for creating a new turtle object. Now, remember that to actually construct the object we need to add the parentheses at the end, and now we can save all of this into an actual object, which we get to name. So I'm going to call my turtle timmy and now I've got a new turtle object. Essentially, we've done the same thing as we have done up here. We've imported a module called turtle, we've tapped into that turtle module here, and then we've fetched something from that module. In this case, it's a variable. And in this case, it's a class which is denoted by the capital T, the Pascal case here. And then we've used the parentheses to initialize or basically construct an object from that blueprint and we've saved it into an object called Timmy. Now I can simplify this code to make it look more like what we had in the slides by saying, instead of import turtle, I can say from, from the turtle module import the turtle class. So now, instead of writing all of this, I can simply just write Timmy equals a new object created from the turtle class and it's constructed. This is how we would construct our new object. So now I have this brand new object called Timmy and if I go ahead and print timmy you can see that when I run this code what gets printed is a new turtle object from the turtle module and it's saved at this location in the computer's memory. So this is very different from say if we just printed a string or a number. It works completely differently. In this case, it's actually a object that's being printed. Now, what can we do with this object? [inaudible] Now, as we saw before with our car object it has certain attributes, right? Like speed and fuel, data that it could keep track of that are really important to the modeling of an actual car object. Now, when it comes to accessing these attributes, the syntax or the code looks like this. Car in this case is the object and then we use a dot or a full stop to separate the object from the actual attribute that we want to get hold of, which in this case is speed. What this code does is it essentially identifies the object and then it says, from this object get the speed attribute. This is actually gonna represent the speed of this particular car object. Coming back to our turtle. One of the other classes that is inside this turtle module is something called screen. And the screen represents the window in which this turtle is going to show up. So let's go ahead and create this screen object. I'm going to call my object my_screen and then I'm going to create it from this blueprint of a screen that we imported. Now we can tap into one of the screens properties which is called the canvas height and canvas width. So let's see what the height is, and notice how we're using that dot notation. So this is the object and then separated by a dot we've got the attributes that we want to access from this object. So I'm going to print that into the console. Now, when I go ahead and run this code, you'll see a window pop up very briefly and that was the screen on which our turtle is going to show up. Now, if you take a look in the console, you can see that not only have we printed the turtle object, but we've also printed the height of the canvas for this particular screen that we've created. So the screen here is the object and that canvas height is an attribute that's associated with that screen. Now, in addition to the things that an object has, so data that it holds like the speed or the fuel which we've already seen, it also has things that it can do, right? So functions that are associated with that particular object. And these functions when it's tied to an object is known as a method. But essentially we would use it the same way as we have done with any other function that we've created so far. The only difference is the syntax. Firstly, we would tap into the car object and then using that same dot notation that we saw with the attributes, we're saying car.stop. So essentially what we're doing is we're getting hold of the object and then we're calling this function that's associated with that object, which is known as a method. So coming back to our code here, one of the things that we can do with this screen object that we've created here called my_screen is we can tap into one of its functions. And because it's a function that's tied to an object, it's actually called a method. So the method name is called exitonclick. And what this will allow us to do is instead of having our screen show up and then quickly disappear when our code ends, this exitonclick will allow our program to continue running until we click on the screen and then it exits our code. So let's try this again and notice how we've now got our screen show up and this canvas has a height of 300 and a width of 300, but now we can see our turtle in the form of the arrow. So this is our a little Timmy shown up in the middle. And our code is only going to exit when the screen detects a click because we've called this function that's associated with the screen object. So now if I click on the screen, you can see process finished with exit code zero, our code is ended and the screen has disappeared. Now there are other functions as well. So if we take our little timmy object and we say, well, timmy, why don't we change the shape of you on the screen and we'll change you into an actual turtle? So now when I run the code, you can see that object in the center is now in the shape of a turtle. Now, if you want to know how I know about all these things I can do with the turtle graphics library, then of course, I'm getting all of this information from the documentation. So in the course resources, you'll see a link to this Turtle graphics documentation, and it tells you all the things that you can do with your turtle. So for example, you can call all of these methods that are associated with your turtle object to get your turtle to move and draw, and you can also use it to change its position or change its coordinates, as well as doing things like changing the color or resetting. And you can browse through this list to see how you would use each of these things. So for example, if I wanted to change the color of my turtle, I can do that by simply just calling this method, color, and then inside the parentheses I pass in the argument of the actual color string. Now you can choose from a whole range of colors just by putting in the name as a string into that method which is called color. So go ahead and see if you can change our turtle timmy's color from the default which is just black to one of the colors that you see in this link here, and the link, of course, is in the course resources. So let's say I want to change it to a coral color like this one. All I have to do is tap into my object which is called timmy, and then call the method which is called color onto it. And you can see all the methods are denoted by a little M here in the circle. Now this color, of course, expects some sort of input. So the input that it expects is a actual string of a color. And my string is going to be coral, which I picked up from here. So now let's run our code and see what it looks like now. Once the screen refreshes, you can see that our turtle is now a nice coral color, and we've managed to do all of this to change the shape, change the color, all because we were able to call these functions which belong to this object. Now see if you can use the documentation here and figure out how to get the turtle to move forward by a hundred paces. Pause the video and try to complete this challenge. All right. So we saw earlier that it has a whole bunch of move and draw methods. So we can simply use this forward method to get it to move forward. And in terms of the parameters that it takes, it takes a number which is going to determine the distance that it's going to move forward by. So we said that we wanted our turtle to move forward by a hundred paces. All I have to do is specify the object that I want to move which is timmy, and then call that method forward and pass in the distance. So I said a hundred paces. So now let's run our code again, and you can see that little turtle just move forward by a hundred paces. So now we've seen how to create a new Object from a blueprint, we've seen how we can tap into its attributes by using the object name dot and then the name of the attribute. So this is the same as having a variable that's associated with that object. And finally, we've seen how we can call methods that are associated with the object. For example, here when we changed the shape or when we changed the color or when we told it to go forwards. Now in the next lesson, I'm going to show you how you can get hold of more external libraries not just turtle, but a whole world of packages that you can tap into. And you can start using these packages of code that other programmers have already developed, and simply by creating objects from the existing blueprints and reading the documentation to get it to do various things that you want it to. So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson. Now, I've mentioned a lot about using code that other developers have written, and the most common way to do this is through using packages of code. In this lesson, I'll show you how to integrate an existing package of code into our project so that we can practice creating objects and working with attributes and methods. Now we've seen modules of code where each file that we create in our project is essentially a module in itself, but a package differs from a module in the sense that it's actually a whole bunch of code that other people have written. Lots and lots of files, all packaged together to achieve some sort of goal or purpose. Now, let's say that we want to create a table of Pokemon and their type, so we wanted some way of documenting that Pikachu is an Electric type, and maybe Squirtle is a Water type. Now, if we wanted to do that in ASCII so that we could print it in the console, well, then we would have to go about formatting it, and it'll be quite painful. So we might have to print some sort of pipe, and then maybe we would have the name of the field, so Pokemon name, and then maybe another pipe, and then we would have the name of the next column, which is their type. And then finally we would close that off, and then we would have to print some sort of horizontal line maybe like this, and so on and so forth, just to create this table. And it's quite difficult if you're not used to manipulating ASCII and visualizing it. I certainly am not up to this task. So what could we do instead? Well, we could search for a Package that other developers have created to achieve this goal, and the place that we would do that is somewhere called PyPI, which is the Python Package Index. And this is a bunch of software for the Python programming language that is developed and shared by the Python community. So we can see their source code, but more importantly, we can see how to implement the code and how to put it into our project. In here, I'm going to search for something called, prettytable. And this is a very simple library that is going to help us to display tables in an ASCII format. We can click on the project links to find out more about it, and this will take us to the Google Code Archive where the documentation is hosted. If you go to Wikis and go to tutorial, you'll see some documentation on how to use it. Now, this particular package is not as extensive as the Turtle graphics package, so there's actually not a lot of things you can do with it, but it's got more than we need for our use case. The first thing we have to do is to install this package into our project. Now, unlike the Turtle package, which is already pre-loaded with every copy of Python, in order to use the packages that you find in the Python Package Index, you actually have to install it. So here's how we do it in PyCharm. First go to the Preferences, so in windows I think it's under File, and then Preferences. On Mac, it's under PyCharm and then Preferences. And then here you'll see a whole bunch of things you can change including the Editor or Appearance, which we've already messed around with. But I want you to click on your project. So my project is called day-16-start. And then we're going to go into the project interpreter. And here we can click on the plus button to install any package that you find in the Python Package Index. Make a note of what it's called, so ours is called PrettyTable. And then we're going to search for it inside the available packages, and once we found it we're going to select it, and then click install. So now it's installed successfully, we can go ahead and close this down, and click Okay. And we can now access this package called PrettyTable in our code. Again I'm going to import it so I can say, import prettytable. And now I can use everything that's inside this package. Now if you want to see the source code you can actually right-click on it and select go to implementation. And this will take you to the Python file where this entire Pretty Table is implemented. So all of the code that they've written. It's a little bit daunting, and it's got a lot of code in it, but we don't have to worry about how the code is created and how it works. All we need to do is look at the documentation for this package and see how we can implement it into our project. Now, in the next lesson, we're going to get some practice constructing a PrettyTable object and, using the documentation to explore this object's attributes and methods. For all of that and more, I'll see you there. In the last lesson, we added an external library to our project. Now it's time to construct a prettytable object and practice using its methods and attributes. Our starting point as always is the documentation. Here you can see how to construct an actual prettytable object. So let's use what we've learned previously about constructing objects to go ahead and create this object from the class. Now, firstly, we're going to do the same thing as we did previously with turtle. We're going to tap into the package prettytable, and then we're going to import the prettytable class noted by the c here. Now that we have access to this class inside our code, I want you to go ahead and create an object from this pretty table class and the object should be named table. So pause the video and give that a go. All right. So we said I'll object is going to be called table, and then we're going to construct it from this class called a prettytable. So we're going to put it in with its casing. So this is the Pascal case that we spoke about earlier on, and then in order to actually give it the go-ahead and construct, we have to add the parentheses at the end. So now you've created a new object called table from this prettytable and we can actually go ahead and print this table. And even at this stage, it's ready going to start printing out a bare bones version all the table. But of course this table has no datas So it's actually kind of hard to visualize what all of these ASCII characters are doing in an empty table. But no matter, the next thing we can see in our documentation is how to go about adding columns. So it's got this method, remember methods are functions that are associated with an object and this method will add columns to whatever table we specify. Now the method takes two inputs. One is the name of the field, so our field names are Pokemon name and type. And then we've got a list of strings which is going to be the data that's going to go into that column. Essentially, every time we call that method, add column, it's going to allow us to give a field name as a string, and then a list of data in order that they're going to go into the table. So we're going to add our table one column at a time. Using that documentation see if you can add both of these columns to our table object and then once you've done that, we're going to print the table object again and we should be to see an ASCII table. This is what you're aiming for when you run your code. It should print out your table and nicely format it in this ASCII style. Pause the video and complete the challenge. Right? All right. So we've got our table object and remember that methods are functions that are associated with the object. So we say table object dot, and then we get to call that method, add_column. And notice how it takes two inputs, the field name and the data that's going to go into the column. So the field name is going to be a string, and this is going to be the name at the top of our column. So in our case, it was called Pokemon name. And then after a comma, we get to put in a list of all the data that's going to go into our column. So just as a quick reminder, our first column contains Pikachu, Squirtle and Charmander. Now, we should have added a column to our table and you can safely ignore all of these typos because of course, Pokemon names are not real words. But if you wanted to check against the poke dex you can actually go to this link in the course resources, and you can see how each of these Pokemon are spelt. Now, the next thing we want to add is the associated type with each of these Pokemons. So for example, Charmander is a fire type of Pokemon, Squirtle is a water type Pokemon, but essentially we're going to add the data that's in the second column. So the field name is called type, and then we've got three pieces of data that's going to need to go into the list in the same order as the previous Pokemon. That way we'll actually match them up properly. So if you haven't already, go ahead and add the second column. Right? So again, I'm going to call the same method on my table and this time I'm going to add the field type and the data is going to go in the order of the data that I had from the previous column. So the first one is the type of Pikachu which is electric. And the second one is the type for Squirtle, which is Water. And finally, we've got fire for Charmander. So now this will be matched to this, this will be matched this and so on and so forth. If we go ahead and print our table now, so if we run our code and take a look in here, you can see how we've now got a nicely formatted table by creating an object from this pre-made prettytable class and we've now called this method add_column to add two columns. And when we print our table, it's now nicely formatted in ASCII. Now, remember that we can also change the object's attributes. For example, if we wanted to change the appearance of our table, that's probably controlled by an attribute. If you scroll down, you can see that we can change the table style by tapping into each of these attributes. For example, if I wanted to change the alignment of my data in the table, I can change this align attribute to L for left-align, C for the center-align or R for right-aligned. Do you remember how to tap into an object's attribute? If you do, go ahead and see if you can change our table from center-aligned by default to left-aligned. Pause the video and try to complete that challenge. Right? So again, we're going to tap into our table object and we're going to use the dot notation, but this time instead of accessing a method associated with the object which is of course denoted by the M, we're going to access an attribute or in this case, they've titled F which is a field. And the one that we want is this align. So let's go ahead and type align, and now we have access to this attribute. Let's see what happens if I go ahead and print this align attribute. You can see that for both of my columns, Pokemon name and type, the align attribute is set to C, which is centered. What I want to do is change the whole table to be left-aligned. Just as we would with any other variable we can of course print it, but we can also change it. And we would change a variable by just using the equal sign, right? So let's change the alignment to left-aligned, and now let's run the code again. And you can see now both of my columns are now aligning with the left hand margin. So we've seen how we can use attributes like the ones here to change the styling of our table. We've seen how we can use methods like add_column or add_row to work with this table object and get it to perform some sort of functionality, like adding pieces of data to it. And we've seen how we can create new objects by simply constructing it from the blueprint class. Feel free to mess around with prettytable as much as you like change, other things about it, or add different pieces of data. But once you're happy with creating the object changing the attributes and calling the methods, then head over to the next lesson where I've got a quiz for you. Now as we start using objects and their attributes and methods, more and more, we're going to start to see why it is that they are so useful and so loved by programmers. Now, I think one of the non-programmers that explained OOP the best is actually the late Steve Jobs, and he has this brilliant example that makes it really clear why objects are so great. In his story, he talks about this concept where let's say you were traveling to Japan, and after a long flight, you finally land and you go outside and there's beautiful cherry blossoms, Mount Fuji is looking wonderful, but unfortunately, on the flight you had soiled your T-shirt. You were overly eager with the tomato juice and you spilled everything on yourself. So what do we do? Well, you're in this unfamiliar city, and you have no idea even where the hell you are, let alone where to find the nearest dry cleaners or launderette. And plus, on top of that, you don't have the local currency, they take Yen, but you only have pounds, and you don't even speak Japanese. So what do you do? It's going to be a real struggle trying to solve this problem. Well, you're staying at a hotel, right? And the hotel staff probably speak English. So you go to the receptionist and you tell the hotel that, hey, my T-shirt is soiled. And they say, \"Hey, no problems, we'll take that from you and we'll go and handle all of that messy stuff. We know how to find the dry cleaners, we can pay them in the local currency and we speak the local language.\" And what you get back is just a nice clean T-shirt. So this is similar to the process of working with objects. Essentially, if you have this Hotel object which has a blueprint for how to handle drycleaning, some sort of clothing, then all you have to do is just get the object, hotel, and then call its associated method dry_clean, and then it will do all of the messy stuff for you. And you don't have to worry about the implementation of this function at all. So now you can work with multiple objects, getting them to do different things and trust that they know how to manage their data and how to perform the necessary functionality. Coming back to a problem that we've already solved, creating that coffee machine with all of the program requirements, well, it's time to put our Object Oriented Programming knowledge to the test, because we're going to be making a OOP version of our coffee machine. Now, the program still has the same requirements as before, you have to print reports for all the resources, you have to check the resources are sufficient, process coins, check transaction is successful, and finally make coffee. But in this case, you're going to be working with objects in the Course Resources, you'll find a link to the starting project for the OOP Coffee Machine. So if you head over to this link, you can see that there's a whole bunch of code that we've already written for you. Now, the idea here is you're not going to touch any of these other files, the money_machine, the menu, or the coffee_maker. All of that code has already been written for you, and it's almost like you're working with an external library. You're just going to trust that they do what they say they do. And you'll find a link to this Coffee Machine Documentation that I've created, which describes in detail what each of these Classes or Blueprints allow you to do. So once you construct an object from the MenuItem Class, then you have access to the name attribute, the cost attribute, ingredient attribute, and there's also descriptions of what it should do and what an example might be. You have access to all of these classes, and you can build objects from each of these classes to solve this project. In order to work with PyCharm, all you need to do is to download the zip file with all the starting code from our Course Resource website. Alternatively...Now once you found that in your downloads folder, all you have to do is uncompress or unzip it, and then you can go into PyCharm and open it here. So click on the Open button, and then navigate to where you had that folder downloaded. Remember it needs to be unzipped. If you're on Windows, right-click the zip file, and choose Extract All, then click Extract. You should see an unzipped folder pop up next to your zip file. If you're on Mac, then all you need to do is just double-click on the .zip file. Now if we click Open on that folder, then it will open up this project, and when you open up the Project folder, you'll see all of the same files. Now you're only going to be working from the main.py. In fact, I don't even want you to care that much about the code that's in the other files. It has class definitions and a whole bunch of other things that we're going to learn about in the next lesson. But for now, I want you to treat it as if it is an external library, which you're just going to use. At the very beginning of the main.py file, I've already imported all four classes that you're going to be using Menu, MenuItem, CoffeeMaker, and MoneyMachine. Now all of these classes are documented in the Coffee Machine Documentation website. All you have to do is head over to this website and read through what each of the classes do. Some of them have attributes and methods, others just have methods. So each of these classes have already pre-written code that do a lot of the heavy lifting, and all of the code that we had to write when we wrote the coffee machine code from scratch. But this time you're only going to be using these four classes and the objects created from them in order to achieve exactly the same goals as before. So while the goals are fresh in your mind from the previous day, you should review the code from the previous day and then have a read of the documentation and see how you would implement exactly the same project, but this time using only the objects created from these classes. You'll need to spend some time on this because you'll need to think through how to create objects from these blueprint classes, and then how to use the objects, how to call the methods and the logic that's required to put everything together. Pause the video now, have a think about this problem, and try to make the Coffee Machine do exactly the same, and have all the same functionality as the coffee machine that you created in yesterday's project. If you got stuck or if you had any problems completing this project, the first port of call is to review the lessons you learned today. It might just be that you need to see some of the theory a few more times and listen to it a few more times and practice it a few more times before you're ready to tackle this final challenge. But if you have completed it and you just want to see the solution, then I'm going to go through it with you right now. Again, we're going to complete all of the program requirements step by step. So the first thing is to print a report for all of the current resources in the coffee machine. Back in PyCharm, I'm actually going to collapse this entire project folder because I'm not going to be writing any code other than inside main.py. Now you can see up here, we've got access to four classes. And if we take a look inside the documentation, you can see that both the coffeemaker class and the money machine class have a method called report. And this is going to print a report of all of the resources like water, milk, coffee, and this is going to print a report of the current profit. So our final report is going to be both a report from the money machine as well as the coffee maker. Let's go ahead and start off by creating some objects from these classes. For example, the money machine is going to be just called money_machine or you could call it my_money_machine. You can actually name your objects anything you like. But I'm just going to use the default Python snake case to create a new variable money_machine, which is going to hold my object. And my object is going to be created, of course, from the money machine class. And the construction happens when I add the parentheses. So now I have a object created and stored inside this variable money_machine. Now, if I want this money machine to create a report, then all I have to do is tap into the object and then write a dot and then call the method that I need, which is report. So now if I go ahead and run my code, you can see it prints out the current amount of money in the machine. Now let's do the same thing for our coffee maker. Again, I'm going to call it coffee_maker, and you see this frequently. The object naming tends to be the lower case and snake case, so separated by underscores, version of the name of the class. So the name of the class is CoffeeMaker, and usually you'll see people name the object exactly the same, but in lowercase. And now that I have my coffee _maker, then I can go ahead and call the report method on that object as well. And now, if I run my code once more, you can see that I've got everything now being reported and printed out. So in this case, we don't actually have to care how report is implementing all of this functionality. All we have to do is read the documentation, find the method that does the thing that we want, and then trust that it will carry out the functionality as described. Now that we've completed step 1, the next one is to check that resources are sufficient. My first port of call is going to be going over to the documentation. And you can see that the coffeemaker class actually has a method called is _resource_efficient. And all we have to do is pass in the drink, which is a menu item, and then it's going to check and give us true, if that drink order can be made, and false if the ingredients are insufficient. So how do we get hold of this drink menu item to pass over to this method? Well, if we take a look at the menu class, you can see it has a method called get_items and this is where you really see reading the documentation properly, actually absorbing everything that's in here becomes really, really helpful. This menu class has two methods that are really useful. One, It's able to get a hold of the names of all the items that are available on the menu. And it returns it as a string separated by forward slashes. It's also able to find a drink based on the order name. So if we passed in one of these names to this function find_drink, then it's going to return a menu item object if it actually exists. Otherwise, it's going to return none. We're going to need both of these in order to ask the user what they want. Let's go ahead and set up our while loop. As we had previously I'm going to create a new variable called is_on and it's going to start off being true. And then while coffee machine is on, well then we're going to get hold of all the options that we can offer the user. And we get that by calling that method get_items. But of course, because this is a method, it's associated with an object. So we have to create an object from this menu blueprint. So let's do that next to all the other objects being created. So let's create a menu object and it's going to be created from the menu class, and then we add the parentheses. And now we have access to that object by the name menu. The options are going to be equal to the menu object and then we're going to call the get_items method. And then when this method returns, it's going to save the string and all the options into this variable called options. Now we can get the user's choice by asking them for what would you like? And then inside a set of parenthesis we'll offer them all the options. And then, of course, I need to turn this into an fstring. And the code highlighting immediately tells me that this is actually now working. So once I've got the user's choice, then I can incorporate the reporting behaviour into this choice. Remember, previously we said if the choice was equal to off, then that means the is_on is going to be equal to false, and elif the choice is equal to report, well, in this case, we're going to get the coffeemaker and the money machine to make their reports into the console. Finally, we're ready to tackle the next problem, which is how do we check that we have enough resources? And this is going to require us to find the drink given the order name that the user chose from the choice and then get hold of the menu item which comes as the output from this method call. So else, we're going to save our drink as a variable called drink, and then we're going to tap into the menu.find_drink. And find_drink, you'll notice, takes a order name as the input. So this is a string and this is going to be equal to whatever the user chose inside this choice. So let's put the choice in here as the input. And now, once we've got hold of this drink, let's go ahead and print it. Remember, we're expecting a menu item object at this stage. So let's click run, and let's make sure that we can hit report to get the report, we can say off to switch off the machine and exit the code, and we can also get hold of a latte by passing in latte as the drink that we want. And we now get printed a menu item object at this particular location in the computer's memory. Perfect. Everything is working as expected. Now, instead of printing the drink, I'm going to tackle this step 2, which is to check that the resources are sufficient. Again, that's going to require us to look through our documentation. And you'll see that the coffee maker class has that method is_resource _sufficient, and it expects a menu item object as the input. And then it's going to return true when it can be made and false if it can't. So let's get hold of our coffee maker object and then get it to check if the resources are sufficient to make the current drink that we're interested in. And let's go ahead and print the results here and run our code. Let's say that we wanted to make a latte. That's going to be resource sufficient, so true. Espresso, also true, and a Cappuccino is also true. So we can make all three drinks, basically. Now, instead of printing this, what we want to do is we want to check if this is true and then proceed to the next step if there are enough resources. Now the next step is to take payment from the user and to process the coins and check the transaction is successful. Notice how in our coffee machine documentation for the money machine, we don't actually have a way of processing the coins. But it what it does have is it allows us to make payments passing in the cost of the drink and then it will return true when the payment is accepted or false, if insufficient. So let's see what happens if we actually try to make payment. Let's tap into our money machine object and then call the make_payment method and we have to pass in the cost of the drink that the user ordered. So we've got the drink object here, which remember is a menu item, and each of the menu items have three attributes that we care about: the name of the drink, the cost of the drink and the ingredient list. So this is what we're interested in at the moment. So we can pass in the drink.cost which is the attribute that's associated with the drink object, and that cost is going to be processed by this make_payment method from the money machine. And then finally, it's going to tell us whether if this was successful or not. So let's see what happens when we run this code as it is. Let's say I wanted a latte, notice how it's asking me to insert coins: how many quarters, how many dimes, how many nickels and how many pennies. A the coffee machine, I don't actually need to care about how the money and the coins are processed. All I had to do is call make_payment and it deals with all of this automatically. Finally, it gives me the change and it returns true, telling me that this make_payment was indeed successful. If you actually look inside the money_machine code, then you can see that it has a method called process_ coins, but it's called when make payment is triggered. This class is going to process coins, and then it's going to decide whether if it was successful or not. And if it was successful, it's going to add the cost to the profit, and if not, it's going to tell you that that was not enough money and your money is refunded. Coming back over here, if this is successful, then that means the user has managed to pay and we fulfilled step 3 and 4 just using one method. The final thing we have to do is to actually make the coffee. And that, of course, happens right at the end here. And all we have to do to make the coffee is get hold of the coffee maker object and then call the make_ coffee method and we can pass in the order, which is our drink. Because remember that the make_coffee method expects a menu item as the input parameter. We can actually simplify this code even more by saying, well, if the coffee maker is_resource_sufficient and the money machine was able to take payment, well then we can get the coffee_maker to make coffee. So now let's go ahead and run our code. And let's report to begin with, to see how much resources we have to begin with. And then let's order a coffee. Insert lots of money and we've got our coffee back. So now let's go ahead and order a different coffee, latte, and let's go ahead and insert lots of money. And you can see, here's my latte. But now, if I hit report, you can see that the objects, the coffee maker has been managing our resources and the money_machine has been managing our profit. Now, if I decided to order another latte, then it should actually tell me, sorry, there's not enough water and there's not enough milk. So it can't make me that drink. And we've managed to achieve all of this functionality by writing very few lines of code, and the code itself is actually very, very easy to understand. Even if you came to this completely fresh, you've never seen how each of the methods are implemented, you don't know how the coffee maker works, you don't know how the money machine works, you can see quite easily what it's trying to do. And so if you only have to write this kind of code, then it would make it so much easier to create even more complex functionality in your coffee machine, right? So have a play around with these classes:"

The prompt should show again to serve the next customer.\n \n \n2.\nTurn off the Coffee Machine by entering \u201c\n\u200b \noff\u200b\n\u201d to the prompt.\n \na.\nFor maintainers of the coffee machine, they can use \u201coff\u201d as the secret word to turn off the\n \nmachine. Your code should end execution when this happens.\n \n \n3.\nPrint report.\n \na.\nWhen the user enters \u201creport\u201d to the prompt, a report should be generated that shows the\n \ncurrent resource values. e.g.\n \n \nWater: 100ml\n\u00a0\nMilk: 50ml\n\u00a0\nCoffee: 76g\n\u00a0\nMoney: $2.5\n\u00a0\n \n4.\nCheck resources sufficient?\n \na.\nWhen the user chooses a drink, the program should check if there are enough resources\n \nto make that drink.\n \n \nb.\nE.g. if Latte requires 200ml water but there is only 100ml left in the machine. It should not\n \ncontinue to make the drink but print: \u201c\n\u200b \nSorry there is not enough water.\u200b\n\u201d\n \nc.\nThe same should happen if another resource is depleted, e.g. milk or coffee.\n \n \n5.\nProcess coins.\n \na.\nIf there are sufficient resources to make the drink selected, then the program should\n \nprompt the user to insert coins.\n \n \nb.\nRemember that quarters = $0.25, dimes = $0.10, nickles = $0.05, pennies = $0.01\n \nc.\nCalculate the monetary value of the coins inserted. E.g. 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, 2\n \npennies = 0.25 + 0.1 x 2 + 0.05 + 0.01 x 2 = $0.52\n \n \n6.\nCheck transaction successful?\n \na.\nCheck that the user has inserted enough money to purchase the drink they selected.

Money refunded.\u200b\n\u201d.\n \nb.\nBut if the user has inserted enough money, then the cost of the drink gets added to the\n \nmachine as the profit and this will be reflected the next time \u201creport\u201d is triggered. E.g.\n \n \nWater: 100ml\n\u00a0\nMilk: 50ml\n\u00a0\nCoffee: 76g\n\u00a0\nMoney: $2.5\n \nc.\nIf the user has inserted too much money, the machine should offer change.\n \n \nE.g. \u201cHere is $2.45 dollars in change.\u201d The change should be rounded to 2 decimal\n \nplaces.\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n7.\nMake Coffee.\n \na.\nIf the transaction is successful and there are enough resources to make the drink the user\n \nselected, then the ingredients to make the drink should be deducted from the coffee\n \nmachine resources.\n \n \n \nE.g. report before purchasing latte:\n \nWater: 300ml\n \nMilk: 200ml\n \nCoffee: 100g\n \nMoney: $0\n \n \nReport after purchasing latte:\n \nWater: 100ml\n\u00a0\nMilk: 50ml\n\u00a0\nCoffee: 76g\n\u00a0\nMoney: $2.5\n \n \nb.\nOnce all resources have been deducted, tell the user \u201cHere is your latte.

      "if you want to have a play around with the final project to get a feel for how it works, then you'll find a link to this final version of the quiz game in the course resources. But once you're ready, then head over to the next lesson and we're going to get started by learning how to create our own custom classes. So, for all of that and more, I'll see you there. So I'm sure you've had a few gos with your quiz now and you've answered all the questions and you know all the correct answers. It's a little bit dry if we only have one question bank, right? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to switch out the question data with some new questions? Now you could certainly write your own questions, just change each of the texts and the answers to whatever question you want to add. An alternative though, is to use the Open Trivia database, which is a free-to-use user contributed trivia question database and it has over 3000 verified questions to pick from. In the course resources I've got a link to the open TDB, the open trivia database, and we can go ahead and take a look at their API to see how we can generate some questions. For example, if I wanted 10 questions on, let's say computers and I want the difficulty to be easy and I want to select the type to be true or false And then I'm going to go and click generate API URL. Now that I've got my URL, I can open up a new tab and go to that location. Now, we'll get some data generated in a JSON format which is a JavaScript object notation but it actually looks pretty much the same as a Python dictionary. So let's go ahead and copy everything that's here and then go into our data.py and I'm going to replace the entire question data with what I got just now. Now once you paste it in, it's going to be very hard to read. So we'll need to go to code and then reformat code in order to get it to look a little bit more normal. So you can see that we've got this dictionary and it has two key-value pairs. One is a response code and another is a list which is under the key results. If I go and reformat this again, you can see that results is comprised of 10 dictionaries. Now, each of these dictionaries contain a whole bunch of key-value pairs and inside each of these key-value pairs it has a bunch of things including the category, that type, the difficulty, the question, the correct answer, and the incorrect answers. So what we can see here is we have a dictionary and then we have these two key value pairs. So you can simply just get rid of the enclosing dictionary and leave it so that you have this as a list of dictionaries. Now, if we go and reformat our code so that we can see each of these dictionary objects, you can see there's a total of five key value pairs and they each have the keys category, type, question, which is the question text and the correct answer which is a string that's true or false. These are the two bits of information that we're interested in. So can you figure out how you can modify the main.py in order to get our quiz to start working again with this new data? Pause the video and complete this challenge. All right. So we've got our question data from the data file, but now we have to change the names of these keys. Whereas before it was called text and answer, now it's called question and correct answer. So the question_text is under the key question and correct answer is under the key correct _answer. So just by changing those two things and pasting all of that data in we can already get started with this brand new quiz. And you can play with it and mess around with different data from the open trivia database, change the category, change the difficulty, and you have endless number of questions to play with. And this really brings about some of the advantages of Object Oriented Programming. Notice how only our main.py file actually has knowledge of how each of these classes work and behave. Our QuizBrain actually didn't need to be touched at all when we changed our data over. This is modularity at its best. We're able to completely switch up the question data to a different language, to a different topic, to a different format, and the quiz brain doesn't care. All it has to concern itself with is how to track which question we're on, how to get the next question, how to check the answer. And as long as it's able to do that and perform the functionality of a quiz, it's unconcerned by where the data comes from, how it's formatted, and it will continue to work. So, as you can imagine, if your colleague was working on quiz brain, they don't actually need to know how the data looks or how it's structured. And you, on the other hand, could be working on the data, getting hold of each of these pieces of data or writing the quiz. And you can already see how we've got a piece of program that's able to be far more complex than what we used to be able to create with simple procedural code. Hey, guys, well done on completing day 17. You are doing amazingly well, and I'm so proud of you. If nobody else ever tell you this, I'm telling it to you right now. You're on day 17, and that's amazing. So one of the things that we have to always bear in mind is that you got to just keep trying. You know, one of the things I used to do when I used to go to school is I have to run for the bus to get the bus, and it would take me 30 minutes to get to school. And very often I would be in the situation where I can see the bus coming and I feel like there's a chance that I might make it or I might not. And the strength of character that you have to build is to run for that bus, even if you don't know if you're going to make it. And sometimes you run so hard, you're sweating, you can't breathe, your lungs feel like it's going to explode and the bus leaves without you, but that's okay because you tried. So this is what I'm trying to say. Run for that bus even if you don't make it because 50% of the time you will. If you keep trying, I believe that you'll succeed. So, just keep going. Throughout all of yesterday, we've been using other people's Classes, and we said that a class is simply just a Blueprint for creating an eventual object. In this lesson, we're going to talk about how we can create our own classes. So our own blueprints, which we can use to create our own objects. Now let's go ahead and create our own custom classes in code. Go ahead and create a new project and we're going to name it day-17-start. And then hit create. And again, as always, once you've created your project, it's time to create your first file, which we're going to name main.py. And then we can collapse our project sidebar and focus on the code. So how do we create a class? The syntax looks very simple. You have the 'class' keyword followed by the name of your class, and then a semicolon. And then all of the code that's in your class will follow this and it will be indented. Let's create our very first class in Python. As I mentioned, the way that we would create a class is first by using the 'class' keyword, and then we get to give our class a name. Let's say that we're building a website, and we need a class to model our website's users. So this class is basically going to be the blueprint to represent what our users have and what they can do on our website. So let's call our class, User, and then we finish this declaration with a semicolon as usual. And everything else that's going to go inside this class is going to need to be indented after the semicolon. Let's start out with a completely empty class. Our User class is going to do absolutely nothing for now. However, because I've created my blueprint, I can already use it to create my first User object. So let's say I wanted to create a user_1, and I'm going to create it using that class which notice it's now being recognized by PyCharm, and it's got the C symbol next to it. And of course to initialize an object from a class we have to add the parentheses at the end. Now we get an error here because there's an indent expected. So basically Python doesn't like it when you create something like a class or when you create something like a function and you have a semicolon, but you don't have anything inside that function or class. For example, if I just immediately wanted to print(\"hello\"), afterwards, I get exactly the same error, Indent Expected. It's expecting this a function that you've created, or this class you've just created to have some sort of content before you go ahead and do something else. So how can we fix this? Well, if we actually really want to leave this function or this class empty, we can use a keyword which is 'pass'. And all it does is it just passes. It says, I don't want to have a go right now. Just continue to the next line of code. And this gets rid of our errors both in the function declaration, as well as in our class declaration. We've now essentially completed the first step towards creating our custom classes, which is writing the declaration, and then building an object called user_1 out of that class. And we've also seen how to name classes in Python. Now, the name of the class should have the first letter of every word capitalized, and this particular style of naming in programming is known as PascalCase. So if you think of Blaise Pascal as a person, then we know that everybody's name, every person's name, has the first letter capitalized and also the first letter of their surname or their middle name, and basically every subsequent name capitalized. Now, this is different from another type of casing which you may have come across, which is called camelCasing. And camel casing is only different from pascal case because the first word is lowercase, but every subsequent word has its first letter capitalized in exactly the same way as pascal case. And finally, we've also come across snake_case, where all the words are lowercase, but they're separated by an underscore. In Python programming, you won't see a lot of camel casing. You will see pascal case being used for the class names, snake_case being used pretty much to name everything else. Now that we've seen how we can create a new class. Even if it's a class with nothing inside. And we've seen how we can create a new object from that class by using the same code that we used in yesterday's lessons. The next question is: \"Well, how do we create an attribute for that class?\". Well, one of the easiest ways of doing this is simply tapping into your object and then adding an attribute. So we could say user_1.id = \"001\". And we could add as many attributes as we want just by using this method of using the dot notation after the name of the object, and then just adding any piece of data we want. So now, if I go ahead and print user_1.username, you'll see that this attribute now exists in this object [Inaudible] And you can see the value that's held in that attribute being printed in the console. So just a quick reminder, an attribute is a variable that's associated with an object. So it's almost as if we just created a new variable, but in this case, we've attached it to an object. But here's a question though, if we had lots and lots of attributes like this, and every single time we create a new user, let's say we created user_2 and we had to do the same thing, create it from the class and then say, user_2.id = \"002\", and user_2.username = \"jack\". And this is one, a little bit prone to error because it's perfectly valid for me to make a typo or change the name of an attribute where I end up with something like this. So is there a way of making this simpler? How can I specify all these starting pieces of information when I create my object from the class? Now, in order to do this, we have to understand something called a constructor, which is a part of the blueprint that allows us to specify what should happen when our object is being constructed. And this is also known in programming as initializing an object. When the object is being initialized, we can set variables or counters to they're starting values. In Python, the way that we would create the constructor is by using a special function, which is the init function. And you can tell it's special because it isn't just the Def keyword and then the name of the function. It's got two underscores either side of the name. And this means that it's a method that the Python interpreter knows about and knows that it has a special function. Now, what is the special function? Well, it's normally used to initialize the attributes. So if inside our class we add this init function and you can see as soon as I write def and then init, I've really got autofill helping me so I can just hit enter once it's selected. Now, inside this init function is where we initialize or create the starting values for our attributes. Now, the important thing to remember is that the init function is going to be called every time you create a new object from this class. For example, if I print, then every time that this construction happens when we create a new user, then this print statement is going to be triggered. So you can see here, this print statement gets triggered and then we print the user_1's username, and then we've got another user being created. Just as a quick reminder, the attributes are the things that the object will have. And they are basically just variables that are associated with the final object. So for example, if you're constructing a car bject, then one of those attributes could be the number of seats it has and normally that's equal to five. So how do we set these attributes in the constructor? Well, this is what the code would look like. We have our init function and inside the init function in addition to this thing called self which is the actual object that's being created or being initialized, in addition, you can add as many parameters as you wish. And that parameter is going to be passed in when an object gets constructed from this class. And once you receive that data, then you can use it to set the object's attributes. This is what it would look like when we actually call our constructor. We know that we can create an object by calling the name of the class and then adding the parentheses. But if inside our init function we have some additional parameters, then we can also pass in data to those parameters which will be used to set the attributes for that object. So in this case, once this line of code has completed, then my_car.seats is going to be equal to five. And this is exactly the same as if we created our my_car object first and then we said my_car.seats = 5. It's completely the same. But it does make it a lot quicker when you're creating a lot of objects that need all the same attributes. Let's see how we would do it here. We've got our init function already declared. So if we wanted to pass over a user ID when we construct our objects, we can add that as a parameter and then inside the init we can say self.id, so self.id is going to be the attribute that's associated with this class and we can set it equal to the user_id that's passed in when any user gets constructed. So now when we create our user, instead of creating these attributes later on, at the time of construction you can already see that we can add a user ID. So let's give it the same ID. And now let's add another attribute. So we're going to pass in the username and I'm going to set the attribute self.username equal the username that's past it. Notice how in this case I've named my parameter user_id and that value is going to become the self.id attribute. So notice how these two actually have different names. You can name either of these anything you want. It's normally convention that you will see the name of the parameter be equal to the name of the attribute, but you don't always have to stick to these rules. Now let's go back to our constructor whereas previously it was empty, now we have our user ID being passed in and I can now pass in the second attribute, which is the username. So my username was going to be Angela. And now we've created a new user, which is user_1 from this user class and we're initializing it with these starting values where the first value is going to become the user ID which is going to be the self.id, and the second value is going to become the self.username. So now, if I wanted to print the user_1's username, then I can simply write user_1.username exactly the same way as before, or if I wanted the ID, it would be user_1.id. So now let's comment out the rest of the code and hit run, and you can see we've got the user ID being printed here. Now, remember that when you add parameters to the constructor which is the init function, you're now saying that whenever a new object is being constructed from this class, it must provide these two pieces of data. If we uncomment this and you try to run it, you'll see you get an error. And it says that on line 12, this user is being created from the user class. But according to the init, we're actually missing two required arguments; user ID and username. So now when we create any object from this class, we have to provide the user ID and the username. But this is now much more convenient, right? While we previously needed three lines of code, we now only have one. Now sometimes when we're creating our attributes, we might want a default value to start with. And if at some later point in our program we want to modify it, then we'll do it at that point. But it doesn't make sense for all attributes to be initialized when we actually create our object. So if, for example, in our case, let's say that we were coding up the Instagram app, right? Well, each of the Instagram users, they would have an ID, they would have a username and they would probably have a follower count. So they might have something like self.followers. This is always going to start out as zero, right? You start a new account, you're going to have zero followers. You might get some followers later on, you might not. But it doesn't make sense for followers to be something that we have to provide whenever we construct a new object. It seems very wasteful to have to always write zero when you construct any object from this class. So in Python, we can also provide a default value just as I've done here. Instead of setting it equal to one of the parameters that's being passed in when this class is being initialized, instead I'm just setting it to a value, which is zero. Let's get rid of that from the initializer because we now have a default value of zero. And if I go ahead and print my, let's say, user_1.followers attribute, and I hit run, then you can see it's zero because all objects being created from this class will have a followers attribute that set out to zero to begin with. In addition to creating attributes, we know that we can also create methods. The attributes are the things that the object has and the methods are the things that the object does. Let's say that we were creating the car class and we've really created the seats attribute. Well, later on we might decide that we want to call a method to change that seats attribute's value. So for example, I've been watching a lot of truck racing recently. Yeah. [inaudible] And one of the things that people do when they mod their cars for racing is they take out some of the seats. This way it reduces the weight of the car, and it means that you can go a bit faster. So in our car class, we might, in fact, have a method where the car can enter race mode, where the seats are dropped from 5 to 2. This is what the method would look like. Inside the class declaration, we have a function, but remember when a function is attached to an object then it's called a method. This method looks exactly the same as how we've created other functions. We have the Def keyword, we have the name of the method, we have some parentheses which can take inputs, a colon, and then the body of the method. So in this case, all it does is it gets hold of the object and then the object seats attribute and then changes it to 2. So now when you call that method, all you need to do is get hold of the object and then you use the dot notation to call that method enter_race_mode, and of course, with the parentheses at the end. So let's say that while we're modeling our Instagram user, we want to have a way for the users to follow each other, right? And when they follow each other, their follower counts obviously go up. So let's define a new method. So we're going to use the def keyword and then we're going to name our method follow. Now a method, unlike a function, always needs to have a self parameter as the first parameter. This means that when this method is called, it knows the object that called it. Now, in addition to that self parameter, we're also going to pass in the user that we've decided to follow. So now let's say that we actually had two attributes, the followers and the following count, right? So they both start from zero, so two default attributes. But when a user decides to follow another user, well in this case, the user who we're following, their follower count goes up by one and our own, so the self.following count goes up by one as well. So the self keyword becomes quite important when we're working with classes and objects. It's a way for us to refer to the object that's going to be created from this class inside the class blueprint. So you'll never see self when you're using objects but you see it a lot when you're writing your code inside your class. Now let's go ahead and call this. And let's say that user_1 decided to follow user_2. This is the user_1 object, and this is the follow method from the user_1 object. And then the user_2 is the person who we're going to follow. So now let's go ahead and print the user_1's follower count and the user_1's following count. And let's do the same for user_2 as well. You can see once this method has run, then user_1's follow account is still zero, but user_1 is now following one person. User_2 has one followers and has zero people that it's following. Right? Now that we've seen how to create our own custom classes, we're finally ready to build the Quiz Game. Now this game is going to be a simple, True / False game, so a question will be asked to the user and they'll select True or False, and then we'll tell them if they got it right or wrong and give them a score. Now to begin, the first step you'll need to do is to download the zip file with all the starting code from our Course Resource website. And once you've extracted the actual folder, quiz-game-start from the .zip file, then we're ready to go ahead and open it using PyCharm. In PyCharm we're going to click Open, and then we're going to navigate to the place where we have our quiz-game-start, which in my case is in the Downloads folder. PyCharm should automatically configure the latest version of Python you've got installed as the interpreter. So you can go ahead and close these pop-ups. And if we open up our quiz-game-start folder, you can see we have four files, data, main, question_model, and quiz_brain. And over the course of the next few lessons, we're going to be writing the code in all of these files so that we end up creating our Final Quiz Project. The first task that we have is to create a model for a question in our quiz. If we had a Question object, well, what kind of attributes should it have? It might have a text attribute for the question text, and it might also hold an answer attribute, which is going to be the correct answer to that question. Now these two attributes should be initialized with a value when a new_q object is created from this class. So for example, if our first question was 2 + 3 = 5, which we know the correct answer should be True, well, then we might write the code like this to actually initialize a new_q object. And when this initialization goes through, the constructor code inside the Question class will take these two pieces of data and then add them to the corresponding attributes, the text and the answer. And so our new_q object will have both of these attributes initialized with a value when a new_q object is being created. Inside your project, go over to the question_model.py file, and go ahead and create a new class called Question, and that Question class should have an __init()__ method which will initialize two attributes the text and the answer, just as you've seen in the previous slides. Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge by creating this class. All right. So we know that to create a class we first have to use the class keyword. And then in our case the name of the class is going to be called Question because we're modeling what a question would be like in our game. We know that each of these questions have two attributes a self.text and a self.answer, and those two attributes are going to be initialized when we create a new_q object, so we need the __init()__ function in here. And we're pretty much going to use the autofill, so once you write 'def', and then you write 'init', you can see it in the dropdown list, and then just hit Enter, and the code will be inserted automatically. This way you don't have to remember the exact order of the parentheses, or where to put the colon, et cetera. et cetera. Now inside the __init()__ function, we're going to set up two attributes s we said, one is going to be called text and one is going to be called answer. And if we want to create an attribute we have to use this syntax self. and then the name of the attribute, because eventually when we create a new object from this class, say a new_q object, then we're going to be passing in these two items a piece of text, which is going to be the question, and then either True or False as the answer. And then later on, if we wanted to access the text, then we would say new_q.text. Now of course, at the moment these are all yellowed out because it seems to have no effect. There's no way of receiving a value for each of these attributes. And to do that we have to add some inputs inside the init function. So let's just call it q_text and q_answer. You can of course call these parameters anything you want, but the important part is you set the self.text to that first value, and the self.answer to the second value. So now when we actually go ahead and print this new_q.text object, like we have here, then it will go ahead and actually fetch this value into the output. If you go to Run and then Run and then select question_model, you can see that is what gets printed in the console. Let's delete those two lines. And now we have completed our first task which is creating our Question class from scratch. Now in the last lesson, we created our question class. In this lesson, we're going to be creating a question bank of question objects. Notice how we can create a question object by using the name of the class and then giving it some inputs for the question and the answer. Now, if we create a whole bunch of those and then put them into a list like this, then we can create a question bank of questions to use in our quiz. If you take a look inside the data.py file, you'll see that I've already included a whole bunch of questions inside here, and you can see it's got some text and it's got some answer. So the exact structure of this file is that it's got a whole bunch of dictionaries, 12 in total, and all of these dictionaries are saved inside a list and that list is called question_data. Now, when you first come onto this file you'll see some warnings, these little yellow squiggly lines. And the reason is because it would expect for proper formatting, each of these dictionaries should be indented inside the list. Now, in terms of actual functionality, this won't change anything. The indentation of the items in a list are not as important as the indentation in say a method or a for loop. But it's still better to get rid of all of these warnings. So what we're going to do is we're going to select everything inside this file, we're going to go to code and then auto-indent lines. And this you'll notice has now auto-indented all of the dictionaries inside the list. Now you'll still notice some red squiggly lines. So in this case, the reason is because the line is too long, it's greater than 120 characters. You can see that's where the cutoff is. So in PyCharm it's really easy to separate lines. If you just identify a good spot in that line, hit enter, and it will automatically add some quotation marks around it so that it still behaves the same way as before, but now it's on separate lines. And I'm going to do the same to line 8 as well. Now the final warning expect a new line at the end of the file, so it let's give it that. And the last thing that you'll notice here is that there's a squiggly line here under Backrub because that is a unknown word in the dictionary. So if you want to, you can actually save words into the dictionary to you get rid of all of these squiggly lines. This is actually a name of a company, so it's probably not going to be in the dictionary. But if you go ahead and put your cursor on it like this, you'll see a little light-bulb light up and you can go ahead and select save 'Backrub' to project-level dictionary, and that will get rid of all of your warnings and errors and you'll see a nice green check mark in the right corner. Now that we've done all of this formatting with the data, let's really examine it. What we have here is a list of dictionaries. Each of the dictionaries have the same key for the question text and the same key for the question answer. So what we need to do is we need to be able to bring this question data into the main.py file. But instead of having a list of dictionaries, we want a list of question objects. We know already that we can create a new question object by simply constructing one from the question and then giving it the required inputs. But in order to do this inside the main.py file, we, of course, have to import the question model and we'll also need to import the data.py. So from the question model I'm going to import the question class, and from the data file I'm going to import the question data. Now that you've got both the question data and the question class, your goal is to create the question bank. And once you're done, it should contain a list of question objects each being initialized with a question and an answer, and the data is going to come from these dictionaries from the question data. So you'll need to think about how you can loop through that question data in order to create this list of question objects. Pause the video and give that a go now. All right. So we know that we need to create this question bank which is going to be a list of question objects. So I'm going to start out just by creating an empty list and then I'm going to loop through each of the questions inside the question data. And for each of these questions, I'm going to create a variable, which we'll call a question_text and the question_text is going to come from those question dictionaries from here. And if we imagine we have one of these dictionaries and we want to get hold of the question_text, then we'll need to tap into the text key. So I'm going to put text inside here and I'm going to do the same thing for the answer. So this is going to be using the answer key that we see right here. So now if we're looping through the first one, we should have 'A slug's blood is green.' and 'True' for these two variables. So now I'm ready to create my new question, which is going to be created from the question class. And you can see that in the constructor, it's expecting two parameters; one is the q_text and another is the q_answer. We can set the q_text to this local variable called question_text, and we can set the answer to the question_answer. And of course, for simplicity sake, we can also get rid of the named parameters and have them just as the parameters like this. So now that we've created this new question object and saved it in the variable new_question, we're ready to add it into our question bank. So we can say a question_bank.append, and we'll append each of these new questions that we create in the for loop. So now if I go ahead and print this question bank, you'll see that when I hit run and select my main file, then it prints out a list denoted by the square brackets and inside the list you've got a whole bunch of question objects. And if you count, there's actually 12 in total, one for each of the dictionaries inside our question_data. So very often when you're getting data from the internet or from somewhere else, it'll likely be in a format that's very similar to this. What we're doing is we're converting each of these pieces of data which has a string key, which means it's very easy to make typos if we're using this in our code everywhere, and we're converting it into a object which now has all of that data in a very easy and foolproof way of accessing the text and the answer. And you'll notice here, if I actually write the wrong thing, then it's actually going to highlight to me this is not something that you can use. And if I start typing, I've also got the help of the auto-insert. Now that we've created our question bank of question objects, the next step is to actually get our quiz up and running. Now that we've managed to create a question bank which consists of a list of question objects, the next natural thing to do is to actually bring up one of those questions and to ask the user to answer the question. Now, for all of the questioning and quizzing functionality, we're going to put that into the QuizBrain, which is going to be a class in its own right. And it's going to manage everything from asking the user for the next question, checking whether if the answer was right and also checking to see if we're actually at the end of the quiz. You're going to be creating this QuizBrain and class and this class is going to have two attributes to begin with; a question number which is going to have a default value of zero because all our quizzes will start from the first question. And this is going to keep track of which question the user is currently on. And we're going to use that number to go through the list of questions which will be passed over to this QuizBrain object when it gets initialized. And then you're going to have a method which is called next_question which will pull up the question from that list depending on which current question number we're on. If you take a look at the final version of the quiz game, you can see that it displays the question number, Q. and then that number. And then it displays the question text, and then it asks the user for an input, true or false. This is what we're going to be focusing on in this lesson. Inside your quiz-game-start, go to the quiz_brain file and create the quiz brain class. Add those two attributes; one is the question number which starts out with a default value and the other is the question list which is going to be initialized when you create a new quiz brain. And we're going to be passing over this question bank here into this question list when we initialize a new QuizBrain. Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge. Right? All right. So let's start off by creating our new class which is going to be called QuizBrain and inside this class, we'll need to initialize some of those attributes, so I'm going to create the init method. Inside the init method I'm going to create that first attribute which was called question_number and I said we would set it to have a default value of zero. So this means every time we create a new QuizBrain object from this class, it's ready going to have an attribute called question_number that set to zero. Now the next attribute is called question_list, and this is not going to have a default value. Instead, it's going to get it as a value passed over. So lets put that as a q_list here and set it equal to question_list. So what's going to happen is inside our main.py file, we're going to be initializing that QuizBrain and the value that we're going to put in there as the question list is going to be the question bank. This way we'll receive the question bank and it will be inside this question list attribute. Now I have another challenge for you. Create a method called next_question inside the QuizBrain. This method needs to retrieve the item at the current question number from the question list. And once you have this item, use the input function to show the user the question text and ask for the user's answer. Pause the video and give this a go. Alright, here's the solution. First we're gonna define a new method called the next_question, and this method is basically going to get hold of the current question and that is of course going to be from the question list. And then we're going to tap into that list and get hold of the item at the current question_number. So for example, question_number is going to start out being zero and so it's going to go into this list which is basically going to be our list of questions from our main.py, so our question bank. And remember, each of the items inside that list is a question object and question objects have text attributes and answer attributes. So in addition to getting hold of the current question, we can then get hold of the current question text by taking the current question and then just simply writing .text to get the value that's saved in that attribute. We're going to use an input to ask the user for what their answer is to this question. This is going to be an fstring because we're going to be inserting the current_ question.text. And at the very beginning if you remember, we also have the Q. and then the number and then the colon. So that will be the self.question_number. And then we've got our colon and then it's going to be the question text. And then we're going to ask the user for a input; true or false. And that's it. That completes the challenge. Now all that's left is to show the very first question to the user and run our code. Let's go back to the main.py and import the QuizBrain class. So we're going to say from the quiz_brain file import the QuizBrain class. And once we've created our question bank, then the next thing to do is to create our new quiz. So this is going to be a new QuizBrain object and when we initialize it, we have to pass in a list of questions. And that is of course going to be the question bank. So now that we've got our quiz up and running, then we can say quiz.next_question. Let's go ahead and run this main.py file. And you can see we get our question text being displayed, true or false being asked, but our question number starts from zero. And that is, of course, because we need zero here in order to get hold of the first question from the list and that's why this has a default value of zero. But by the time we reach this input, it would be really good if this actually read one instead of zero. So one way we could do this is we could do this plus one, but remembering that we actually need to increase the question number every single time we call next_question anyways, then once we've gotten hold of the current question, we can actually tap into that self.question_number and increase it by one. This will have the same effect, and if you look at it now we've got the right question number being shown here, the right text being shown, and then we can insert true or false. Now at this stage, our program is just going to exit. In the next lesson, we're going to have to work out a way for our questions to keep being asked. And we'll need to write some more code for that to work. In the previous lesson, we managed to get our QuizBrain up and running and to start asking the user for their answer. But currently, there's no way for our program to continue to the next question once the user has typed an input. However, if we take a look at the final version of the quiz game, you can see once the user's typed an input, it then goes to the next question and shows them the question number 2 and the question text for that second question. How can we create that functionality to work with our QuizBrain? Well, if we could create another method called still_has_questions well then inside our main.py we could probably create a while loop and the while loop checks if the quiz still has questions remaining. Well, then in that case, we're going to keep going to the next question. So how do we create this functionality and how do we create it inside the QuizBrain? Your job is to create a new method here which is going to be called still_has_questions. And this is going to return a boolean, either true or false. And depending on that boolean, we can get our while loop to keep working and keep running and looping, or we're going to get the loop to stop once the quiz has run out of questions. Here's the behavior that you're looking for by the end of the challenge. The while loop should continue serving up the next question to the user until we reach the end of the quiz. Have a think about how the question number and the length of the question list relate to each other and see if you can complete this challenge. All right. So we know that we can get the length of our question list by using the Len function. Currently, in all the current version of the question bank, we have 12 questions in total. So the length is going to be 12. Now we want our loop to keep going until we've reached the number of questions in our list. What we could do is we could check to see if the self.question_number is less than the length of self.question_list. In that case, we'll return true, but otherwise we'll return false. Remember that this question number gets increased every time we show the user the next question. It starts out being zero and then it goes immediately to one. And then we get to the end of the next question function and we get to our while loop. So in our while loop, we can check to see if the quiz still has questions. And if this is true, then go to the next question. But if it's false, then exit the loop and we're at the end of the game. Back inside our QuizBrain we can actually simplify this method even more because we know that this is going to be evaluated by the computer and it's going to be either that true or false. If it is it's true then it goes into this block. And if it's false, then it goes into the else block. We can actually save ourselves all of this effort by simply just returning this expression. Now, what it's going to do is, let's say that a = 5 and b = 3. And if we were to return five is greater than three, then this is basically the same as this expression which gets evaluated by the computer. And when this code runs, it's going to be either true or it's going to be false. So that that value is then going to be straight away returned by this method back into this while loop to see if we should continue going to the next question or not. So let's run this file and you can see it asks me the first question. And then it's going to go to the next question. And then it's going to basically keep going until it gets to the end of the list of questions and then it ends our entire program. In the next lesson we're going to figure out how we can check the answer that the user has inputted here and see if its actually the correct answer. Currently when we run our code you can see that while we can input our answer, our code doesn't actually really care because it's not checking to see if it's right or wrong. In this lesson we're going to add one more method to our QuizBrain and that's the ability to check the answer that the user inputted and see if it was correct. And that means we need to keep track of the user's score. So we'll add another attribute score which has a default value of zero to begin with and it'll increase every time they get a question right. So in this lesson, we're going to create a new method called check_answer. And this check_answer function is going to be used to see if the user's answer which comes from this input is the same as the actual answer to the current question. What we need to do is we need to save this user's input inside a variable which we'll call user_answer. And then I'm going to call our check_answer method and I want to pass over the user_answer. Now, in addition, I also want to pass over the correct answer and the correct answer is going to be the current_question.answer. So let's replace that with current_question.answer because we know that current_question is a question object which has a text attribute and an answer attribute. And once we've passed over the user's answer and the correct answer, then we can receive it inside our check_answer function as a parameter. So we'll call this user_answer and the second one we'll call the correct_answer. So now this input is going to be passed over here and the correct answer is going to be under this variable name. So now we can see if the user_answer is equal to the correct_answer. And just for safety sake, it's usually a good idea to drop both sides to a lowercase so they are comparable. This way just in case the user answers True or true, it will be treated exactly the same. If the user_answer matches the correct answer, well then this means that they got it right, so let's print it. But on the other hand, if that was false then that means they got it wrong. So let's tell them that's wrong. Now it might also be a good idea to tell the user what the actual correct answer was. Now you have a choice depending on where you want to put that. So you can either choose to only show them the correct answer if they got it wrong like this. But I think it's actually a good idea to show them the correct answer even if they're got it right. So I'm going to change the indentation so that it's actually outside of the if/else block, and it's just simply going to happen once the if/else block is complete. Now, the next thing to do is to keep track of the user's score so that every time they get a question right then it should increase the score by one. Pause the video and add a new attribute called score to the QuizBrain class and increment it by one every time the user gets it right. Now, what you're aiming for is to be able to print out the score and the current question so that you can tell the user 'Your current score is:' and printed out after every single question. Pause the video now and complete this challenge. All right. So let's go ahead and create our new score attribute which is again going to have a default starting value of zero. And then whenever the user gets a question right, then we're going to increase their score by one. So let's tap into that score attribute and then increase it by one. Now we've got our score being tracked, then we want to be able to print out what the users' current score is. So at the end of the check_answer, let's create another print statement which gives the user their score. So 'Your current score is:' and then we'll insert the self.score. And we'll also tell them out of a possible number of questions, so we can insert the self.question_number. So this means that they've completed five questions so far where they've had five chances to get things right then we can show them that they got however many right out of those five. So maybe they got 3/5 right, or maybe they got 5/5 right. And now if we run our code, we can see that print statement in action. So it tells me that I got it right and then the-- and then the correct answer was true. And that my current score is 1/1. Right Now, if I get one of these wrong, then you can see that my current score is now 3/4. And it tells the user that they've missed out on one point. It'd be nice to add a little bit of space in between each of the questions. I want to be able to see all the questions that I've done so far. So I don't want to clear the screen, but I want to be able to add a new line here. So at the end of my print statement, I'm going to add a print which is just going to print a new line. So that in between each question I have a little bit of space to tell each question apart from the other. The final thing I need to do is to tell the user their final score once the entire quiz is finished, and we want to be able to print something like 'You've completed the quiz' and then we'll print out, um, something like 'Your final score was:",
      "username = \"jack\"",
      "id = \"001\"",
      "b = 3",
      "print(\"hello\")",
      "While we previously needed three lines of code, we now only have one. Now sometimes when we're creating our attributes, we might want a default value to start with. And if at some later point in our program we want to modify it, then we'll do it at that point. But it doesn't make sense for all attributes to be initialized when we actually create our object. So if, for example, in our case, let's say that we were coding up the Instagram app, right? Well, each of the Instagram users, they would have an ID, they would have a username and they would probably have a follower count. So they might have something like self.followers. This is always going to start out as zero, right? You start a new account, you're going to have zero followers. You might get some followers later on, you might not. But it doesn't make sense for followers to be something that we have to provide whenever we construct a new object. It seems very wasteful to have to always write zero when you construct any object from this class. So in Python, we can also provide a default value just as I've done here. Instead of setting it equal to one of the parameters that's being passed in when this class is being initialized, instead I'm just setting it to a value, which is zero. Let's get rid of that from the initializer because we now have a default value of zero. And if I go ahead and print my, let's say, user_1.followers attribute, and I hit run, then you can see it's zero because all objects being created from this class will have a followers attribute that set out to zero to begin with. In addition to creating attributes, we know that we can also create methods. The attributes are the things that the object has and the methods are the things that the object does. Let's say that we were creating the car class and we've really created the seats attribute. Well, later on we might decide that we want to call a method to change that seats attribute's value. So for example, I've been watching a lot of truck racing recently. Yeah. [inaudible] And one of the things that people do when they mod their cars for racing is they take out some of the seats. This way it reduces the weight of the car, and it means that you can go a bit faster. So in our car class, we might, in fact, have a method where the car can enter race mode, where the seats are dropped from 5 to 2. This is what the method would look like. Inside the class declaration, we have a function, but remember when a function is attached to an object then it's called a method. This method looks exactly the same as how we've created other functions. We have the Def keyword, we have the name of the method, we have some parentheses which can take inputs, a colon, and then the body of the method. So in this case, all it does is it gets hold of the object and then the object seats attribute and then changes it to 2. So now when you call that method, all you need to do is get hold of the object and then you use the dot notation to call that method enter_race_mode, and of course, with the parentheses at the end. So let's say that while we're modeling our Instagram user, we want to have a way for the users to follow each other, right? And when they follow each other, their follower counts obviously go up. So let's define a new method. So we're going to use the def keyword and then we're going to name our method follow. Now a method, unlike a function, always needs to have a self parameter as the first parameter. This means that when this method is called, it knows the object that called it. Now, in addition to that self parameter, we're also going to pass in the user that we've decided to follow. So now let's say that we actually had two attributes, the followers and the following count, right? So they both start from zero, so two default attributes. But when a user decides to follow another user, well in this case, the user who we're following, their follower count goes up by one and our own, so the self.following count goes up by one as well. So the self keyword becomes quite important when we're working with classes and objects. It's a way for us to refer to the object that's going to be created from this class inside the class blueprint. So you'll never see self when you're using objects but you see it a lot when you're writing your code inside your class. Now let's go ahead and call this. And let's say that user_1 decided to follow user_2. This is the user_1 object, and this is the follow method from the user_1 object. And then the user_2 is the person who we're going to follow. So now let's go ahead and print the user_1's follower count and the user_1's following count. And let's do the same for user_2 as well. You can see once this method has run, then user_1's follow account is still zero, but user_1 is now following one person. User_2 has one followers and has zero people that it's following. Right? Now that we've seen how to create our own custom classes, we're finally ready to build the Quiz Game. Now this game is going to be a simple, True / False game, so a question will be asked to the user and they'll select True or False, and then we'll tell them if they got it right or wrong and give them a score. Now to begin, the first step you'll need to do is to download the zip file with all the starting code from our Course Resource website. And once you've extracted the actual folder, quiz-game-start from the .zip file, then we're ready to go ahead and open it using PyCharm. In PyCharm we're going to click Open, and then we're going to navigate to the place where we have our quiz-game-start, which in my case is in the Downloads folder. PyCharm should automatically configure the latest version of Python you've got installed as the interpreter. So you can go ahead and close these pop-ups. And if we open up our quiz-game-start folder, you can see we have four files, data, main, question_model, and quiz_brain. And over the course of the next few lessons, we're going to be writing the code in all of these files so that we end up creating our Final Quiz Project. The first task that we have is to create a model for a question in our quiz. If we had a Question object, well, what kind of attributes should it have? It might have a text attribute for the question text, and it might also hold an answer attribute, which is going to be the correct answer to that question. Now these two attributes should be initialized with a value when a new_q object is created from this class. So for example, if our first question was 2 + 3 = 5, which we know the correct answer should be True, well, then we might write the code like this to actually initialize a new_q object. And when this initialization goes through, the constructor code inside the Question class will take these two pieces of data and then add them to the corresponding attributes, the text and the answer. And so our new_q object will have both of these attributes initialized with a value when a new_q object is being created. Inside your project, go over to the question_model.py file, and go ahead and create a new class called Question, and that Question class should have an __init()__ method which will initialize two attributes the text and the answer, just as you've seen in the previous slides. Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge by creating this class. All right. So we know that to create a class we first have to use the class keyword. And then in our case the name of the class is going to be called Question because we're modeling what a question would be like in our game. We know that each of these questions have two attributes a self.text and a self.answer, and those two attributes are going to be initialized when we create a new_q object, so we need the __init()__ function in here. And we're pretty much going to use the autofill, so once you write 'def', and then you write 'init', you can see it in the dropdown list, and then just hit Enter, and the code will be inserted automatically. This way you don't have to remember the exact order of the parentheses, or where to put the colon, et cetera. et cetera. Now inside the __init()__ function, we're going to set up two attributes s we said, one is going to be called text and one is going to be called answer. And if we want to create an attribute we have to use this syntax self. and then the name of the attribute, because eventually when we create a new object from this class, say a new_q object, then we're going to be passing in these two items a piece of text, which is going to be the question, and then either True or False as the answer. And then later on, if we wanted to access the text, then we would say new_q.text. Now of course, at the moment these are all yellowed out because it seems to have no effect. There's no way of receiving a value for each of these attributes. And to do that we have to add some inputs inside the init function. So let's just call it q_text and q_answer. You can of course call these parameters anything you want, but the important part is you set the self.text to that first value, and the self.answer to the second value. So now when we actually go ahead and print this new_q.text object, like we have here, then it will go ahead and actually fetch this value into the output. If you go to Run and then Run and then select question_model, you can see that is what gets printed in the console. Let's delete those two lines. And now we have completed our first task which is creating our Question class from scratch. Now in the last lesson, we created our question class. In this lesson, we're going to be creating a question bank of question objects. Notice how we can create a question object by using the name of the class and then giving it some inputs for the question and the answer. Now, if we create a whole bunch of those and then put them into a list like this, then we can create a question bank of questions to use in our quiz. If you take a look inside the data.py file, you'll see that I've already included a whole bunch of questions inside here, and you can see it's got some text and it's got some answer. So the exact structure of this file is that it's got a whole bunch of dictionaries, 12 in total, and all of these dictionaries are saved inside a list and that list is called question_data. Now, when you first come onto this file you'll see some warnings, these little yellow squiggly lines. And the reason is because it would expect for proper formatting, each of these dictionaries should be indented inside the list. Now, in terms of actual functionality, this won't change anything. The indentation of the items in a list are not as important as the indentation in say a method or a for loop. But it's still better to get rid of all of these warnings. So what we're going to do is we're going to select everything inside this file, we're going to go to code and then auto-indent lines. And this you'll notice has now auto-indented all of the dictionaries inside the list. Now you'll still notice some red squiggly lines. So in this case, the reason is because the line is too long, it's greater than 120 characters. You can see that's where the cutoff is. So in PyCharm it's really easy to separate lines. If you just identify a good spot in that line, hit enter, and it will automatically add some quotation marks around it so that it still behaves the same way as before, but now it's on separate lines. And I'm going to do the same to line 8 as well. Now the final warning expect a new line at the end of the file, so it let's give it that. And the last thing that you'll notice here is that there's a squiggly line here under Backrub because that is a unknown word in the dictionary. So if you want to, you can actually save words into the dictionary to you get rid of all of these squiggly lines. This is actually a name of a company, so it's probably not going to be in the dictionary. But if you go ahead and put your cursor on it like this, you'll see a little light-bulb light up and you can go ahead and select save 'Backrub' to project-level dictionary, and that will get rid of all of your warnings and errors and you'll see a nice green check mark in the right corner. Now that we've done all of this formatting with the data, let's really examine it. What we have here is a list of dictionaries. Each of the dictionaries have the same key for the question text and the same key for the question answer. So what we need to do is we need to be able to bring this question data into the main.py file. But instead of having a list of dictionaries, we want a list of question objects. We know already that we can create a new question object by simply constructing one from the question and then giving it the required inputs. But in order to do this inside the main.py file, we, of course, have to import the question model and we'll also need to import the data.py. So from the question model I'm going to import the question class, and from the data file I'm going to import the question data. Now that you've got both the question data and the question class, your goal is to create the question bank. And once you're done, it should contain a list of question objects each being initialized with a question and an answer, and the data is going to come from these dictionaries from the question data. So you'll need to think about how you can loop through that question data in order to create this list of question objects. Pause the video and give that a go now. All right. So we know that we need to create this question bank which is going to be a list of question objects. So I'm going to start out just by creating an empty list and then I'm going to loop through each of the questions inside the question data. And for each of these questions, I'm going to create a variable, which we'll call a question_text and the question_text is going to come from those question dictionaries from here. And if we imagine we have one of these dictionaries and we want to get hold of the question_text, then we'll need to tap into the text key. So I'm going to put text inside here and I'm going to do the same thing for the answer. So this is going to be using the answer key that we see right here. So now if we're looping through the first one, we should have 'A slug's blood is green.' and 'True' for these two variables. So now I'm ready to create my new question, which is going to be created from the question class. And you can see that in the constructor, it's expecting two parameters; one is the q_text and another is the q_answer. We can set the q_text to this local variable called question_text, and we can set the answer to the question_answer. And of course, for simplicity sake, we can also get rid of the named parameters and have them just as the parameters like this. So now that we've created this new question object and saved it in the variable new_question, we're ready to add it into our question bank. So we can say a question_bank.append, and we'll append each of these new questions that we create in the for loop. So now if I go ahead and print this question bank, you'll see that when I hit run and select my main file, then it prints out a list denoted by the square brackets and inside the list you've got a whole bunch of question objects. And if you count, there's actually 12 in total, one for each of the dictionaries inside our question_data. So very often when you're getting data from the internet or from somewhere else, it'll likely be in a format that's very similar to this. What we're doing is we're converting each of these pieces of data which has a string key, which means it's very easy to make typos if we're using this in our code everywhere, and we're converting it into a object which now has all of that data in a very easy and foolproof way of accessing the text and the answer. And you'll notice here, if I actually write the wrong thing, then it's actually going to highlight to me this is not something that you can use. And if I start typing, I've also got the help of the auto-insert. Now that we've created our question bank of question objects, the next step is to actually get our quiz up and running. Now that we've managed to create a question bank which consists of a list of question objects, the next natural thing to do is to actually bring up one of those questions and to ask the user to answer the question. Now, for all of the questioning and quizzing functionality, we're going to put that into the QuizBrain, which is going to be a class in its own right. And it's going to manage everything from asking the user for the next question, checking whether if the answer was right and also checking to see if we're actually at the end of the quiz. You're going to be creating this QuizBrain and class and this class is going to have two attributes to begin with; a question number which is going to have a default value of zero because all our quizzes will start from the first question. And this is going to keep track of which question the user is currently on. And we're going to use that number to go through the list of questions which will be passed over to this QuizBrain object when it gets initialized. And then you're going to have a method which is called next_question which will pull up the question from that list depending on which current question number we're on. If you take a look at the final version of the quiz game, you can see that it displays the question number, Q. and then that number. And then it displays the question text, and then it asks the user for an input, true or false. This is what we're going to be focusing on in this lesson. Inside your quiz-game-start, go to the quiz_brain file and create the quiz brain class. Add those two attributes; one is the question number which starts out with a default value and the other is the question list which is going to be initialized when you create a new quiz brain. And we're going to be passing over this question bank here into this question list when we initialize a new QuizBrain. Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge. Right? All right. So let's start off by creating our new class which is going to be called QuizBrain and inside this class, we'll need to initialize some of those attributes, so I'm going to create the init method. Inside the init method I'm going to create that first attribute which was called question_number and I said we would set it to have a default value of zero. So this means every time we create a new QuizBrain object from this class, it's ready going to have an attribute called question_number that set to zero. Now the next attribute is called question_list, and this is not going to have a default value. Instead, it's going to get it as a value passed over. So lets put that as a q_list here and set it equal to question_list. So what's going to happen is inside our main.py file, we're going to be initializing that QuizBrain and the value that we're going to put in there as the question list is going to be the question bank. This way we'll receive the question bank and it will be inside this question list attribute. Now I have another challenge for you. Create a method called next_question inside the QuizBrain. This method needs to retrieve the item at the current question number from the question list. And once you have this item, use the input function to show the user the question text and ask for the user's answer. Pause the video and give this a go. Alright, here's the solution. First we're gonna define a new method called the next_question, and this method is basically going to get hold of the current question and that is of course going to be from the question list. And then we're going to tap into that list and get hold of the item at the current question_number. So for example, question_number is going to start out being zero and so it's going to go into this list which is basically going to be our list of questions from our main.py, so our question bank. And remember, each of the items inside that list is a question object and question objects have text attributes and answer attributes. So in addition to getting hold of the current question, we can then get hold of the current question text by taking the current question and then just simply writing .text to get the value that's saved in that attribute. We're going to use an input to ask the user for what their answer is to this question. This is going to be an fstring because we're going to be inserting the current_ question.text. And at the very beginning if you remember, we also have the Q. and then the number and then the colon. So that will be the self.question_number. And then we've got our colon and then it's going to be the question text. And then we're going to ask the user for a input; true or false. And that's it. That completes the challenge. Now all that's left is to show the very first question to the user and run our code. Let's go back to the main.py and import the QuizBrain class. So we're going to say from the quiz_brain file import the QuizBrain class. And once we've created our question bank, then the next thing to do is to create our new quiz. So this is going to be a new QuizBrain object and when we initialize it, we have to pass in a list of questions. And that is of course going to be the question bank. So now that we've got our quiz up and running, then we can say quiz.next_question. Let's go ahead and run this main.py file. And you can see we get our question text being displayed, true or false being asked, but our question number starts from zero. And that is, of course, because we need zero here in order to get hold of the first question from the list and that's why this has a default value of zero. But by the time we reach this input, it would be really good if this actually read one instead of zero. So one way we could do this is we could do this plus one, but remembering that we actually need to increase the question number every single time we call next_question anyways, then once we've gotten hold of the current question, we can actually tap into that self.question_number and increase it by one. This will have the same effect, and if you look at it now we've got the right question number being shown here, the right text being shown, and then we can insert true or false. Now at this stage, our program is just going to exit. In the next lesson, we're going to have to work out a way for our questions to keep being asked. And we'll need to write some more code for that to work. In the previous lesson, we managed to get our QuizBrain up and running and to start asking the user for their answer. But currently, there's no way for our program to continue to the next question once the user has typed an input. However, if we take a look at the final version of the quiz game, you can see once the user's typed an input, it then goes to the next question and shows them the question number 2 and the question text for that second question. How can we create that functionality to work with our QuizBrain? Well, if we could create another method called still_has_questions well then inside our main.py we could probably create a while loop and the while loop checks if the quiz still has questions remaining. Well, then in that case, we're going to keep going to the next question. So how do we create this functionality and how do we create it inside the QuizBrain? Your job is to create a new method here which is going to be called still_has_questions. And this is going to return a boolean, either true or false. And depending on that boolean, we can get our while loop to keep working and keep running and looping, or we're going to get the loop to stop once the quiz has run out of questions. Here's the behavior that you're looking for by the end of the challenge. The while loop should continue serving up the next question to the user until we reach the end of the quiz. Have a think about how the question number and the length of the question list relate to each other and see if you can complete this challenge. All right. So we know that we can get the length of our question list by using the Len function. Currently, in all the current version of the question bank, we have 12 questions in total. So the length is going to be 12. Now we want our loop to keep going until we've reached the number of questions in our list. What we could do is we could check to see if the self.question_number is less than the length of self.question_list. In that case, we'll return true, but otherwise we'll return false. Remember that this question number gets increased every time we show the user the next question. It starts out being zero and then it goes immediately to one. And then we get to the end of the next question function and we get to our while loop. So in our while loop, we can check to see if the quiz still has questions. And if this is true, then go to the next question. But if it's false, then exit the loop and we're at the end of the game. Back inside our QuizBrain we can actually simplify this method even more because we know that this is going to be evaluated by the computer and it's going to be either that true or false. If it is it's true then it goes into this block. And if it's false, then it goes into the else block. We can actually save ourselves all of this effort by simply just returning this expression. Now, what it's going to do is, let's say that a = 5 and b = 3. And if we were to return five is greater than three, then this is basically the same as this expression which gets evaluated by the computer. And when this code runs, it's going to be either true or it's going to be false. So that that value is then going to be straight away returned by this method back into this while loop to see if we should continue going to the next question or not. So let's run this file and you can see it asks me the first question. And then it's going to go to the next question. And then it's going to basically keep going until it gets to the end of the list of questions and then it ends our entire program. In the next lesson we're going to figure out how we can check the answer that the user has inputted here and see if its actually the correct answer. Currently when we run our code you can see that while we can input our answer, our code doesn't actually really care because it's not checking to see if it's right or wrong. In this lesson we're going to add one more method to our QuizBrain and that's the ability to check the answer that the user inputted and see if it was correct. And that means we need to keep track of the user's score. So we'll add another attribute score which has a default value of zero to begin with and it'll increase every time they get a question right. So in this lesson, we're going to create a new method called check_answer. And this check_answer function is going to be used to see if the user's answer which comes from this input is the same as the actual answer to the current question. What we need to do is we need to save this user's input inside a variable which we'll call user_answer. And then I'm going to call our check_answer method and I want to pass over the user_answer. Now, in addition, I also want to pass over the correct answer and the correct answer is going to be the current_question.answer. So let's replace that with current_question.answer because we know that current_question is a question object which has a text attribute and an answer attribute. And once we've passed over the user's answer and the correct answer, then we can receive it inside our check_answer function as a parameter. So we'll call this user_answer and the second one we'll call the correct_answer. So now this input is going to be passed over here and the correct answer is going to be under this variable name. So now we can see if the user_answer is equal to the correct_answer. And just for safety sake, it's usually a good idea to drop both sides to a lowercase so they are comparable. This way just in case the user answers True or true, it will be treated exactly the same. If the user_answer matches the correct answer, well then this means that they got it right, so let's print it. But on the other hand, if that was false then that means they got it wrong. So let's tell them that's wrong. Now it might also be a good idea to tell the user what the actual correct answer was. Now you have a choice depending on where you want to put that. So you can either choose to only show them the correct answer if they got it wrong like this. But I think it's actually a good idea to show them the correct answer even if they're got it right. So I'm going to change the indentation so that it's actually outside of the if/else block, and it's just simply going to happen once the if/else block is complete. Now, the next thing to do is to keep track of the user's score so that every time they get a question right then it should increase the score by one. Pause the video and add a new attribute called score to the QuizBrain class and increment it by one every time the user gets it right. Now, what you're aiming for is to be able to print out the score and the current question so that you can tell the user 'Your current score is:' and printed out after every single question. Pause the video now and complete this challenge. All right. So let's go ahead and create our new score attribute which is again going to have a default starting value of zero. And then whenever the user gets a question right, then we're going to increase their score by one. So let's tap into that score attribute and then increase it by one. Now we've got our score being tracked, then we want to be able to print out what the users' current score is. So at the end of the check_answer, let's create another print statement which gives the user their score. So 'Your current score is:' and then we'll insert the self.score. And we'll also tell them out of a possible number of questions, so we can insert the self.question_number. So this means that they've completed five questions so far where they've had five chances to get things right then we can show them that they got however many right out of those five. So maybe they got 3/5 right, or maybe they got 5/5 right. And now if we run our code, we can see that print statement in action. So it tells me that I got it right and then the-- and then the correct answer was true. And that my current score is 1/1. Right Now, if I get one of these wrong, then you can see that my current score is now 3/4. And it tells the user that they've missed out on one point. It'd be nice to add a little bit of space in between each of the questions. I want to be able to see all the questions that I've done so far. So I don't want to clear the screen, but I want to be able to add a new line here. So at the end of my print statement, I'm going to add a print which is just going to print a new line. So that in between each question I have a little bit of space to tell each question apart from the other. The final thing I need to do is to tell the user their final score once the entire quiz is finished, and we want to be able to print something like 'You've completed the quiz' and then we'll print out, um, something like 'Your final score was:",

      "if you look at this painting, at least it's got quite a few dots, right? You're getting your money's worth of dots, but look at this one. This is the same artist, Damien Hirst, and this painting I counted only has 25 spots, and this sold for \u00a30.5 million. It's not even about the number of spots, so I personally still, as you can see, can't really work out contemporary art. But what I can work out is how to get Python code to crack Damien Hirst's colour palette, and use those colours to generate a random canvas of spot paintings that look equally, if not more appealing, than some of the original Damien Hirst's. So this is what we're going to be making as our project. And we're going to be using that Package, colorgram to get hold of the color palette, and then we're going to use those colors to create our own spot painting that's going to look like this. Firstly, we're going to be using a package called colorgram, and colorgram is a library of code written in Python that lets you extract colors from images. So for example, if you take a look at this picture, once it was run through color gram and ten of the most common colors extracted, you end up with a palette that pretty much looks the same as the colors in the image. This is the example of how you would use this colorgram package, and in this case, they're extracting six colors from an image. So it basically takes two inputs an image, and the number of colors. If we go into Google image search and we search for a Hirst spot painting, you can see that there's a lot of spot paintings that this guy created. I want you to pick a painting with a color palette that you like. Maybe something like this, or maybe a bit brighter, like this one. But essentially, pick one of these images and then go ahead and download it. So save image, and then you're going to save that image as image.jpeg. So jpg, and then go ahead and hit Save. Now go ahead and create a new PyCharm project I've called mine hirst-painting. You can call yours whatever you want. Now we're going to drag our newly downloaded image, image.jpg into this project folder, hirst-painting. And it's going to ask you whether, if you want to move the file from, in my case, the downloads folder to my hirst-painting project. So then we're going to agree and click Refactor. So now this painting is inside my hirst-painting project, and I'm ready to go ahead and create a new file called main.py, which is what I'm going to use to extract the colors from this image. Here's a challenge for you. See if you can figure out how to use this package, colorgram, using their project description here and using the example code. What you're aiming for is to be able to print out a list of all the colors extracted from the image, and each item in the list to be a tuple that you create. So remember previously we saw how the turtle module likes to work with color tuples, which are created with an amount of red, the amount of green, and the amount of blue, all contained inside a tuple. This is the format that you're going to try and get your data into. It might take a little bit of wrangling and a little bit of thought. Pause the video and complete this challenge. All right. So we know that in order to use external packages, ones that weren't installed with the Python standard library, we have to first install the package. To install a package, we go to our Preferences and then we select our project, and then we go to our Project Interpreter. Now we click the plus button and we search for colorgram. And there it is. Now let's go ahead and install the package. And once that's installed successfully, then we can close all of this and click Okay. Now that we've got our package we can actually import it. So we'll import colorgram. And we can use the method that's described here called color gram.extract() in order to get hold of six colors. Now, if we want more colors, for example, in this image there's probably a good 30 colors, so let's go ahead and extract 30 colors from this image, but of course our image is not called, sweet_pic.jpg, ours is actually called image.jpg. So let's go ahead and rename this image so that it matches with our file. And remember that your image has to be at the same level as your main.py for this kind of code to work. So make sure that you've got it inside the hirst-painting project folder on the same indentation level as main. Now let's go ahead and print out our colors that are generated. And remember that when you hit Run, this process might take a little while. And the author of the library says that for a 512 * 512 image, it takes about 0.66 of a second. Obviously, if the image is larger, it'll probably take a bit longer. Let's go ahead and hit Run and see what we get. Once the process is finished, you can see it's created some colors and these colors are in a list. And it's got some different formats for the color. To understand that we have to go back to our documentation. You can see that the color that's extracted can either be a RGB color, which is what we're interested in, or a HSL color, which is not quite what we want. So let's go ahead and write a for loop that taps into each of those colors. So 'for color in colors:",
      "for color in ",
      "while ago. And we're going to be using Python turtle to create a similarly beautiful dot spot painting, which could be randomized and create beautiful pieces of art like this one. Once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and let's get started. This might seem a bit of an odd question, but have you ever been to an art museum and looked at the exhibition and thought to yourself, \"I think I could probably do this, and I don't really understand why it's considered art.\" Well, this is a piece of art by Goldschmied and Chiari called, \"Where Should We Go Dancing Tonight?\" And it's meant to be a piece of concept art, but when the museum cleaners came here at the end of the day and looked at this mess of cigarette butts and shoes and random bottles, they thought it was rubbish, and they promptly cleaned everything up. So this is what the exhibition looked like after the cleaners were done the next day. So to the museum's horror, their star exhibition gets cleared up and mistaken for rubbish. So I was talking to a friend and I said, well, you know, a lot of these modern art pieces, I could probably do it, right? We could probably get together, put some bottles on the floor, make a mess, call it art. And he told me, \"Actually, no, you can't. And you should read this book called, the $12 million Stuffed Shark.\" And it talks all about the Economics of Contemporary Art. And it's a fascinating read. I've learned so much more about how contemporary art is priced, and why they're priced the way they are, but it also led me to discover some pretty big, shocking discoveries. Like, for example, the art piece that's referred to on the cover of the page is this shark. It's a shark that was fished off of the coast of Australia, and then it was preserved in formaldehyde, but it was preserved really badly, like they didn't use enough chemicals, and the shark started going a bit green and a bit of gray in other places, and it also started molding, but this moldy, green shark was bought for $12 million. And this is not even the craziest piece. So, for example, this diamond encrusted skull was reportedly sold for $50 million. And these butterfly wings, which have been dissected and stuck to a canvas, was sold for 8.5 million. So who exactly is this crazy man who's creating all of these pieces of art that's fetching these insane valuations? Well, it's a guy called Damien Hirst, and I think out of all his paintings, the craziest ones are the spot paintings, because it's literally spots of color that are organized randomly on a page. And check this out, this particular piece was sold for a whopping \u00a31.275 million, so maybe like $1.5 million. It's insane for a painting of dots. But what I thought was even crazier is if you look at this painting, at least it's got quite a few dots, right? You're getting your money's worth of dots, but look at this one. This is the same artist, Damien Hirst, and this painting I counted only has 25 spots, and this sold for \u00a30.5 million.

      "while loop and basically end the snake movement and end the game. Let's go ahead and test this out. So let's let the snake hit the wall and you can see it no longer continues moving forward. But for the user, this might be a little bit confusing. It doesn't seem like it's actually game over. It seems like it's just crushed. So let's go ahead into our scoreboard which does a lot of the writing and let's create a new function which is going to be called game_over. And this game_over function is going to simply just write some texts, not the score, but instead it's just going to write 'GAME OVER' onto the screen using the same alignment and the same font. But instead of it at the position which we initially defined which is right at the top, let's go ahead and get it to go to the center, which is at (0, 0). So now when the snake hits the wall, not only does the snake stop moving, but we're also going to get the scoreboard to trigger the game over a sequence. So that means when it hits the wall, game over shows up in the middle of the screen, and you can still see the score that was written previously because we don't actually hit clear before we write this game over. And this means that the user can see that the game is over, the snake has stopped moving, and they can see their final score. So let's try to score some points. And once I've done that, I'm gonna hit a wall and it's game over and I can see that my score was 2. All right guys, we're at the final stretch. All we have left to do now is to figure out how we can detect when the snake collides with its own tail. As a snake gets longer and longer, it's more likely that at some point the head might hit some part of the tail. And in the snake game, this means it's game over. So we have to figure out how we can detect this and then trigger the game over sequence. One of the things that we've left until now is a way of extending the snake every time it gets some food, because at the moment what's happening is our snake is staying the same size with only three segments. But now we need to change that. We need to add a segment to the snake every single time it hits the food so that it grows in length and we can start detecting collision with the tail. The place we're going to do that is inside our snake class. So we're going to create a function that's going to be called extend. And this extend function is going to add a new segment to the snake. So we're probably going to need another function, which is going to be called add_segment, and this is going to require the position to add the segment to essentially. Notice how this is the part of the code where we actually add the segment. So lets take it out of the for loop and put it into the add_segment. And so we can now call this function, self.add_segment and then pass in this position that we're looping through. These two functions together are going to create our snake. But in addition, we're going to use this add_segment when we want to extend the snake. But what position do we want that last piece to go to? Well, we're going to get hold of the list of segments and we're going to get hold of the last one. Remember that with lists in Python, you can write a negative number so that you start counting from the end of the list. For example, if our list was 1, 2, and 3, then this list at minus one position would be 3. Effectively we're getting hold of the last segment in our list and then we're going to get hold of it's position. And remember, this is a method that comes from the turtle class and we can call it by writing position and then parentheses and we'll get the position of that segment. And then we're going to add this new segment to the same position as the last segment. So now if inside our main.py every time our snake collides with the food, then not only are we going to refresh the food, but we're also going to get the snake to extend itself. So lets go ahead and run this game again. And notice how this time, once I hit the food, the snake actually extends itself and it gets longer each time. So now we're able to think about how to detect tail collision because as the snake gets longer, this tail collision becomes more of a problem. We're more likely to get tangled with our own tail. Let's go ahead and add a comment here which will say 'Detect collision with tail.' And the way that we want to check this is we wanna say if the head collides with any segment in the tail, then this means that we're going to trigger the game over sequence. So how can we detect if the head collides with any segment in the tail? Well, we could loop through our list of segments in the snake. So we could say for segment in snake.segments, so out of all the snakes segments, let's go through each one of them. And then we can say that well, if the snake.head has a distance of, let's say, I don't know, less than 10 from any of those segments that we're currently looping through, well that probably is a collision, right? So in that case, we're going to set the game_is_on to false and we're going to get the scoreboard to trigger the game over sequence. Now there's just one problem with this. If we go ahead and run the code as it is, you can see that immediately we get game over. And the reason is because out of all of the snake segments, the head is the first segment. So when we loop through each of the segments, the first segment is going to be the snake head. And so we're detecting if the snake head has a distance to the snake head of less than 10, which of course it is going to. So we need some sort of way of bypassing the snakehead. So we could say if the current segment that we're looping through is equal to, so double equal, to the snake.head, well, in this case, we're going to pass. But if this is not the case, so in the elif after the if statement, then we can check to see if the snake head has a distance to the segment of less than 10. Now, if we rerun this code, you'll see that it works exactly as we expect it to. We can move our snake around and as soon as the head hits the body, then it's game over for us. We've pretty much now completed the snake game. But in the next lesson, I want to talk about a special functionality in Python which is called slicing. And this is something that you will often see in code in the wild, and we'll use that to improve our code just a little bit more. So for all of that and more, I'll see you there. Now while our snake game works now with all of the functionality that we set out to create, there's just one thing that bothers me a little bit about this code, and it's how wordy this section is. All that we're trying to do is make sure that we're detecting the distance from all of the segments that we're looping through in snake.segments other than the first one. Surely there's an easier way of doing this rather than writing all of these lines of code. And indeed there is. But in order to use it, we have to learn about a Python concept known as slicing. Let's say that we had a list of piano keys all the way from a to g, and we wanted to get hold of a small section of this list. Let's say we wanted to slice the list so that we only get the c, d, and e keys from this list. How would we do that using Python? Well, one way of doing that is you could write a for loop and you could check, well, is it c, is a d, is it d. If so, then add it to a new list. But that's really convoluted. We have a much, much better way of doing that in Python. And it's known as slicing. This is what the syntax would look like. We would get hold of our lists, piano_keys, and then we would use a set of square brackets, but instead of accessing just one item with a position, we get a set of items by slicing it from position 2 to position 5. This might be a little bit confusing because we know that a is that position 0, b is at 1, c is at 2, but the one at position 5 is actually f, so how does this get us c, d, and e? Well, you have to visualize it like this. Imagine that zero position is actually at the beginning of the list before where a starts. And at the end of the list, we're actually at the slicing position of 7. If we think about it this way, then the way that we're slicing this list is going all the way from position 2 to position 5 then of course, we would end up with c, d, and e. If you take a look at this code in my Repl.it, I've essentially got the same code that we saw in the slides and we're slicing this list of piano keys from position 2 to 5. When I hit run, you will see that what gets printed is c, d, and e, exactly the slice that we wanted. Now, there's other things that you can do with slicing that's pretty cool. So, for example, if you wanted to slice from position 2, which remember is right here because we're starting at 0, 1, and 2, and you want to slice it all the way to the end of the list, well, you can just emit the second number. You can have two and then a colon. Now, when you slice this you get all of the rest of the list starting from the position that you specified. And this works in the opposite direction as well. Let's say that we want to get hold of everything up to position 5. Well, we could omit the first number, add a colon, and then after the colon specify the end slice position. And now we get all of the items in the list up to that position 5. In addition to just slicing between two numbers, we can actually specify a third number after another colon. And what this number does is it sets the increment. For example, we wanted the slice from a position 2 to position 5, but we want to only get every other item. So then it would give c, it would skip over the second one, and then it would give us e. And if I hit run, this is exactly what you see. So let's say I wanted to get hold of everything in this list but I wanted every second item. Well, then this is what my code would look like, go from the beginning to the end and then skip every second one. And I end up with a, c, e, and g. Now to extend this a little bit further, we can actually use this neat trick to specify a -1 as the increment and what this does is it will actually reverse this list for us going from right to the end to the beginning. So essentially the increments are by one, but it's by -1, so that way we get the list starting from the end all the way back to the beginning. And this is a really neat trick that you'll see a lot of people use when it comes to manipulating lists and tuples. So speaking of tuples, this method of slicing also works for tuples. So let's say we had a piano tuple, which remember is defined by a set of parentheses with items inside separated by commas. Well, we can use the same method of slicing to work with our tuple. So we use our square brackets, let's get hold of the items from section 2 to 5. Then when we hit run, you'll see it gives us mi, fa, so. So coming back to our code, I have a challenge for you. Can you figure out how to use what we've just learned about slicing to change this code so that we get rid of this if statement where we're passing over the snake head so that we are in fact only checking that the snake head has a distance to every segment other than the first segment, less than 10? If you managed successfully to do this, you should be able to get rid of this if statement, change this to a single if statement and somehow figure out a way of making this code work using slicing. Pause the video and give this a go. Alright, so we know that we want to loop through every segment in snake.segments other than the first one. Well, all we need to do is simply slice this list of segments. So we can get hold of everything that starts off from position 1 to the end, by writing 1:",
      "for segment in ",
      "for example in ",
      "num_eyes = 2",
      "if you inherited the same eyes as your mother, or if you inherited the same nose as your grandfather, but you can also inherit behavior. So maybe you chop tomatoes in the same way that your dad chops tomatoes. And if you believe my mother, I'm lazy in the same way that my dad is lazy. So not only can win inherit appearance, but we can also inherit behavior. Now, how does inheritance actually work in terms of the code? Well, we can define a class, let's call it Fish, and it has an initializer. Now, in order to get this Fish class to inherit from another class, all we have to do is to add a set of parentheses after the name of the class, and then provide the class that we want to inherit from. So in this case, our Fish is inheriting from the Animal class. And then in order to get hold of everything that an animal has and is so its attributes and methods, all we have to do is inside the __init__(), add this super().__init__(), and this super refers to the superclass. So basically initialize everything that the superclass can do in our Fish class. Let's take a look at this in terms of real code. First I'm going to create an Animal class, and this Animal class is going to have an initializer where we're able to define some attributes. Right? So let's say that all animals have two eyes, so num_eyes = 2. Now at the same time, I'm also going to define a method associated with this Animal class. Let's say that all animals know how to breathe. So inside this breathe() method, I'm going to keep it quite simple, I'm just going to say, (\"Inhale, exhale\"). So that's breathing done. Now later on I decide to define a Fish class, and this Fish class probably also knows how to do certain things. So for example maybe it knows how to swim, right? Right now if I create an object from this Fish class, let's say I create an object called nemo that's created from the Fish class, then I can say nemo.swim(). And you can see when I run this code it says that nemo is moving in water. Now what if I wanted this Fish class to inherit everything that the Animal class can do, including the attribute, num_eyes, and also the method breathe()? All I have to do is to add this Animal class after the name of the Fish class inside parentheses, and then I have to add the initializer and inside the initializer, I have to trigger a call to the superclass(), which is in this case the Animal class, and then I'm going to call the initializer like this. So now what these two parts of the code does is it allows anything that's created from my Fish class to inherit all of the attributes and methods from the superclass, which is the Animal class. Now I can get my nemo to start breathing and you can see if I hit Run, then it will also Inhale and exhale. And in addition, if I wanted to print, nemo.num_eyes then you can see this is also going to print too. So now my object that's created from the Fish class now has access to all the attributes and methods from the superclass that inherited from the Animal class. Now what if I wanted to inherit a method so get all the things that it does, for example in the breathe() method, but what if I wanted to modify it a little bit? So for example, a Fish does in fact breathe, but it kind of breathes underwater. So let's say I wanted to define the breathe() function, and I want it to have the same functionality as the superclass which I'm inheriting from. So I want to print, inhale, exhale, but I also want to do something extra. Well in this case we would get hold of the superclass and then call breathe() on it. This means we're going to do everything that the breathe() method from the superclass does. So all of this. But afterwards we're going to do something a little bit more special. So we're going to say, \"We're doing this underwater.\" Now when this line nemo. breathe() gets run, you can see what happens is it will print out Inhale, exhale, and this comes from the superclass's breathe() method here. And then afterwards it will print its own unique twist on breathing, which is, \"doing this underwater.\" By learning about inheritance, what it allows us to do is to take an existing class that we've created, or somebody else has created, and then build on top of it without having to reinvent the wheel and redefine everything that's in that class. So in the next lesson, I'm going to show you how we can inherit from the turtle class, to upgrade the turtle, to be able to do extra things, such as creating a piece of food, or creating a scoreboard For all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson. All right, so now that we've learned all about inheritance, it's time to apply the theory to our snake game. And we're going to use it to detect collision with food. Our snake should be able to hit a piece of food, which is just going to be a blue circle. And every time it touches the food, the circle moves to a new random location on the screen. If we take a look at our code, you can see that the Main.py controls the entire game. It dictates how the screen should behave and how the snake behaves. Now, everything that's to do with the snake, its appearance and behavior is all captured inside a class. So everything snake related is inside the snake class. So what we want to be able to do is to create a new food.py file. And this foo.py is going to be its own class. And the food class is going to know how to render itself as a small circle on the screen, and then every time the snake touches the food, then that food is going to move to a new random location. So let's create the initializer for this food class. And one of the things that we're going to need to do is we're going to need to import turtle. So from the turtle module let's import the turtle class. And this piece of food that we're going to see on screen is going to be a turtle object. Instead of creating it as an attribute in this class. So self dot food equals turtle. Like this. What we want to be able to do is we actually want this class food to inherit from the turtle class. So that way this food class is going to have all of the capabilities of the turtle class, but it's also going to have some specific things that we're going to tell it how to do, so that it behaves like an actual piece of food. Here's a quick challenge from what you learned in the last lesson. Can you figure out how to make this food class inherit from the turtle class? Pause the video and give that a go. All right, so we mentioned that there's only two steps we need to do. First is after the name of the class, we add some parentheses and then put in the name of the class that we want to inherit from. So in this case it's the turtle class. And then the next thing we need to do is we need to call the turtles init method inside the food's init method. And you can see that as soon as you've added this inheritance here, this init starts giving us a warning. And when you click on it, you can see it says call to init of superclass is missed. So it actually knows what we need to do next. That means if we click on the light bulb, we can actually automatically just add in the Superclass's call this. Of course, you could just type it out and it's good for practice. But in case you're ever wondering if you get these warnings, you can always take a look at what PyCharm is recommending. Now we've actually created our food class and we've inherited from the turtle class. What that means is we can now start using things that are from the turtle class. For example, I can straight up say self dot shape and it knows what shape is. This is a method that the turtle class has that I'm now going to modify in my food class. So when I initialize a new piece of food, I'm going to make sure that it has a circular shape. And I'm also going to get it to pen up so that it doesn't draw. And then I'm going to define its size. And there's something called shape size which I can use. And what this allows me to do is to stretch the turtle along its length and along its width. Now I'm not actually going to stretch it bigger than it is. It's normally 20 by 20 pixels, but I want to turn it into ten by ten pixels. So I'm going to stretch the length by 0.5. So I'm basically going to halve it. And then I'm going to stretch the width also by 0.5. So now it should be a ten by ten circle which I've created by defining the shape size. Now remember all of these methods shape size pin up shape comes from this turtle superclass. And we're only able to use it because we're inheriting from the superclass. So that our food class is now also sort of a turtle, but it's more like a souped up turtle. Finally, let's go ahead and define the color, which I'm going to set as blue. But of course, feel free to set it as anything you like. And I'm also going to set the speed of my turtle to a fastest. This way I don't have to look at the animation of the food being created at the center of the screen and then moving to the location that I want it to. Speaking of moving, we're going to need to use the go to to get it to go to a random XY location. So let's import the random module and let's create a random x which is going to be random.randint. Remember that our screen is 600 by 600. So that means that our x axis goes from -300 to positive 300. And our y axis goes from positive 300 to -300. Now we don't want our food to be right at the edge of the screen, because it will be really hard to get the snake to go to right at the edge. It'll probably just die on the wall. So we want to maybe subtract this a little bit so we can go from -280 to plus 280 and the same on the y axis. So let's generate a random integer from -280 to positive 280. and let's generate a random y integer in the same range. So now we can tell our food to go to a random x and a random y. All of this is going to happen as soon as we create a new food object from the food class. Remember, whenever you initialize a new object from the class, the init gets called back in our Main.py right below where we initialized our snake. We're going to initialize our food. So food equals the food class and then parentheses. And of course we need to get hold of our food class from the food file like this. Another thing you'll notice is that this turtle is now grayed out, because we're not using that class anywhere inside the main.py. So we can delete that, which gets rid of all our warnings on this page. And we get the green check mark. Our food up high looks good. Our snake up high looks good. And we're now ready to go ahead and run this code. Notice how we've got our snake moving around on screen. And at this point it doesn't really matter about the walls, it's just moving around anywhere it likes. But more importantly, we've got our food being randomly generated on the screen right here. Now the next step is how can we detect when the snake and the food have come into contact, and then to tell the food to move itself to a new random location? Well, we're going to do that inside our main.py right after we've got our screen updating, our snake moving. Then we're going to detect collision with food. And we're going to do that by using a method from the turtle class called distance. The distance method works by comparing the distance from this turtle to whatever it is that you put inside the parentheses. So the x could be a pair of numbers x and y, or it could simply just be a turtle instance. So you're comparing this turtle against another turtle. And you're trying to get hold of the distance between the two turtles. So what that means is we can check to see if the distance from the first segment of the snake. So remember that would be snakehead dot distance. And then the distance that we want to know is what is the distance from the snake's head to the food. At this point you can check to see if it is less than a certain amount. Then it's pretty likely that the snake head is now colliding with the food. So we know that the food is ten by ten. So if we add a bit of a buffer, Let's just say if the snakehead is within 15 pixels of the food, or even closer. So if the distance is less than 15, then we can be pretty much certain that they've collided. So let's go ahead and print something. I'll just write nom. Nom nom. So if we go ahead and run our code and let's just get our snake back into view, and if I now go and touch this piece of food, if I can, then you can see. Nom nom nom being printed in the console. Now let's go ahead and touch it again. You can see as soon as I collide with that food I get that print statement executing. So now instead of just writing nom nom nom, let's figure out what we need to do next. What we want to happen is the food should go to a new random location. And of course that comes from this part of the code. So why don't we go ahead and create a new method which will call refresh. And this refresh method is going to create a new random x, a new random y, and then get the food to go to that new random location. Then inside our init we can simply just call self dot refresh. So be careful that you didn't write reset, because that's one of the methods from the turtle class that we're inheriting from. But what we actually want is to call this refresh method so that the food goes to a new random location, and then back inside our main.py when the snake head collides with the food, then we're going to get the food to refresh its own location. So check this out. Now when I hit the food, then you can see the food now appears at a new random location like that. Now, depending on how accurate you want the snake to hit the food, so it might need to hit it dead on. Or if you're happy with it just gliding past and counting that as a collision, then you could decrease the number here from 15 to 10. Now I've done a bit of testing, and this number seems to be the best distance in order to get a valid collision. But feel free to tweak around with the number and see how it goes. There we go. We've managed to figure out how to create a piece of food by inheriting from the turtle class. Get the food to be generated, and then to move to a new random location every time the snake head collides with the food. Now, I know that in the snake game, the snake segments increase once it hits a piece of food, but we're only going to add that functionality at the very end of this project when we're detecting collision with the snake tail, so don't worry about that for now. Guys, we've already come really, really far. We've done all of this and now we're on this stage, creating a scoreboard. So what we want is to be able to write some text in our program that keeps track of the score, of how many pieces of food we've actually managed to eat. Now, the score should update every single time we hit a new piece of food and it's going to stay there and keep updating itself every time we hit a new piece of food. Now this scoreboard is also going to be a turtle. So one of the things that you can do with your turtle is you can get it to write a piece of text. And this is what the method looks like in the documentation. You can tell it what it should write, what kind of alignment you want, do you want it to be in the center of the screen, on the left or right side of the screen? And then what kind of font you want? So the font name, font size and font type, so normal or heavy or bold or underlined, and we would call it more or less like this. So here's a challenge for you. I want you to go ahead and create a new file called a scoreboard.py. And inside this file, I want you to create a new scoreboard class. Now, this scoreboard class is going to inherit from the turtle class, just as we did with the food class. And then the scoreboard is going to be a turtle which knows how to keep track of the score and how to display it in our program. Feel free to choose whatever font you want, whatever size you want, but the end outcome we're looking for is something that looks a bit like this and the score is going to need to be tracked inside that scoreboard class. And it needs to be increased by one every single time the snake eats a piece of food. You're going to need the help of the documentation, you're going to need to read up on how this turtle.write method works, and you're also probably going to need this turtle.clear so that you clear the writing every time you update the score. Have a think about how you would solve this and then go ahead, pause the video and give it a go. [inaudible] All right. So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create my scoreboard class. And as I mentioned, this class needs to inherit from the turtle class. So from the turtle module, let's get hold of the actual turtle class so we can use it inside this file. And then I'm going to add it to my scoreboard as the superclass. Now, if I create my inits, I can go ahead and use this light bulb to insert the superclass call. So now my scoreboard is a class that can do everything a turtle class do. And one of the things I want it to do is I want it to keep track of the score. So let's say it starts out at zero, and we want to be able to write this onto the screen. So we can say self. write, and let's use an f-string to say score, and then we can insert the self.score value in here. And then we can add whether if we want it to be aligned to the center, for example, and then we can also add a font if we need to. Let's use the same font as here, Arial, and then we're going to make the font size a bit bigger, and then we're going to keep it as normal. So I'm going to choose an Arial font, size 24, and then the style is going to be normal. And as you can see here, I'm getting a warning here and it's telling me that it expected a tuple, but instead it just got a single string. So let's just compare this against the documentation code and you can see that this is meant to be a tuple instead of just a single piece of string. So let me go ahead and fix that. Let's add some parentheses around this, and then this Arial is going to be a string, this 24 is going to be a number and the normal is going to be a string. And now our errors have gone away. So now going back to our main.py let's go ahead and create our scoreboard as an object from the scoreboard class, which of course means that we need to import it into this file. So from the scoreboard file import the Scoreboard class. And now if I run this code, somewhere in the middle there I've got a scoreboard, but because it's actually black, you can't really see it. It's really important that we change the color of the scoreboard turtle before we write the text, because if it was written as black and then we change it to white, you still won't notice a difference. So if I change the self.color right here to white and I hit run, then you can see that scoreboard showing up. But if I move this line of code to after we've written it, then it won't actually make a difference. It's still written in black somewhere on there. Now, in addition, we want to get rid of the turtle that shows up when we create our scoreboard because all we want it to do is we want it to write, we don't want it to actually show up a turtle. Self.hideturtle, and now that little arrow disappears. And we probably don't want this scoreboard to be bang in the middle. So let's move it. Let's tell it to go to a particular X and Y position. Now, in example, here, I've got it in the center, right at the top. So we can keep the X as zero, but let's move the Y further up to the top. So let's say something around 270. And now if we test it again, you can see that the turtle went to the top, but this happened after this line was already written. So again, this needs to happen before we write. And now if we refresh, you can see it's moved to the top, but it's also drawn on a path to do that. So instead of doing that, we can tell it to self.penup before it moves to this location. There we have it. We've got our score showing up at the top. Now, all that's left to do is to keep track of the score and to increase it whenever the snake hits a new piece of food. So we know that that happens inside this if statement, when the snake head collides with the food, then we refresh the food, but we also want to increase the score. So let's go ahead and create a function inside our scoreboard class called increase_score. And this function is going to take the self.score and add one to it. And then it's going to call self.write. So now back inside our main.py, we can get whole of our scoreboard object and tell it to increase score whenever the snake collides with the food. So let's test this again. And if I manage to hit the food, then you can see that the score is being updated, but what's happening is that the score is being written on top of the previous scores. So it's just all overlapping with each other. So instead, what we need to do is between each time we update the scoreboard, we actually have to delete what was previously on there. And because we've now got these two lines which are pretty much identical in two places, let's go ahead and create a function instead. We'll call update_scoreboard, and inside this function, we'll have our self.write. And we can call self.update_scoreboard here and also here. So now before we increase the score and call update scoreboard, we can call self.clear to clear the previous text that was written by this turtle, which is the scoreboard. Now, if we run this again you can see that when I do score, my scoreboard is wiped and then the new text code is written. So it doesn't overlap with the previous scoreboard. The final thing I want to do just as a finishing touch is I don't like having these hard-coded pieces of text inside the body of my programs. So instead it would be much better if we could take these pieces of texts out and create constants with them. So we could have one that's called ALIGNMENT set to center, and then another one called a FONT, which is going to be set to this tuple. And then I can use these constants down here, so align = ALIGNMENT, font = FONT. That way, when I decide that I want to change something about the alignment or the font, so for example instead of Arial, I might go for something that is a little bit more video-gamey sort of font like courier, then I don't have to dig through the body of my program to find out where it was defined. I can just look at the top which contains all the constants and then fix it right here. That shouldn't have changed any of the functionality. It's just made our scoreboard look a bit more video-gamey, and you can see how it works perfectly. We've coded up the majority of this game now already. All that's left to do is to define the two situations where we might get game over. And that is detecting collision with wall and detecting collision with tail. So let's tackle the easier one first. We want the snake once it gets past a certain point that's very close to the four walls to trigger the game over sequence. So we know that we have a 600 by 600 screen and the X and Y axis go to 300 and -300 at all four sides. So if we create a boundary box that say 280 here, 280 here, -280 and -280, then as soon as the snake head touches that position, then once it zoomed past it, then we can say that the snake has pretty much hit the wall. Now this number is not perfect, it's just what I found to work after doing a lot of testing. And this is the case with a lot of games, you have to test it, run it, see if it works the way you want it to. But let's go ahead and add a comment, detect collision with a wall, and let's create our if statement. So what we want to say is if the snake.head has a X coordinate that is greater than 280, so it's gone too far to the right, or if it has a X coordinate that is less than -280, so it's gone too far to the left, or if it has a Y coordinate that's greater than 280, so too far to the top, or if it has a Y coordinate that is less than -280 so it's gone too far to the bottom, if any of these four situations occur then it basically means that the snake has hit the wall. So what do we want to happen when the snake hits the wall? Well, we want to change this game_is_on to false because what that's going to allow us to do is to exit the while loop and basically end the snake movement and end the game. Let's go ahead and test this out. So let's let the snake hit the wall and you can see it no longer continues moving forward. But for the user, this might be a little bit confusing. It doesn't seem like it's actually game over. It seems like it's just crushed. So let's go ahead into our scoreboard which does a lot of the writing and let's create a new function which is going to be called game_over. And this game_over function is going to simply just write some texts, not the score, but instead it's just going to write 'GAME OVER' onto the screen using the same alignment and the same font. But instead of it at the position which we initially defined which is right at the top, let's go ahead and get it to go to the center, which is at (0, 0). So now when the snake hits the wall, not only does the snake stop moving, but we're also going to get the scoreboard to trigger the game over a sequence. So that means when it hits the wall, game over shows up in the middle of the screen, and you can still see the score that was written previously because we don't actually hit clear before we write this game over. And this means that the user can see that the game is over, the snake has stopped moving, and they can see their final score. So let's try to score some points. And once I've done that, I'm gonna hit a wall and it's game over and I can see that my score was 2. All right guys, we're at the final stretch. All we have left to do now is to figure out how we can detect when the snake collides with its own tail. As a snake gets longer and longer, it's more likely that at some point the head might hit some part of the tail. And in the snake game, this means it's game over. So we have to figure out how we can detect this and then trigger the game over sequence. One of the things that we've left until now is a way of extending the snake every time it gets some food, because at the moment what's happening is our snake is staying the same size with only three segments. But now we need to change that. We need to add a segment to the snake every single time it hits the food so that it grows in length and we can start detecting collision with the tail. The place we're going to do that is inside our snake class. So we're going to create a function that's going to be called extend. And this extend function is going to add a new segment to the snake. So we're probably going to need another function, which is going to be called add_segment, and this is going to require the position to add the segment to essentially. Notice how this is the part of the code where we actually add the segment. So lets take it out of the for loop and put it into the add_segment. And so we can now call this function, self.add_segment and then pass in this position that we're looping through. These two functions together are going to create our snake. But in addition, we're going to use this add_segment when we want to extend the snake. But what position do we want that last piece to go to? Well, we're going to get hold of the list of segments and we're going to get hold of the last one. Remember that with lists in Python, you can write a negative number so that you start counting from the end of the list. For example, if our list was 1, 2, and 3, then this list at minus one position would be 3. Effectively we're getting hold of the last segment in our list and then we're going to get hold of it's position. And remember, this is a method that comes from the turtle class and we can call it by writing position and then parentheses and we'll get the position of that segment. And then we're going to add this new segment to the same position as the last segment. So now if inside our main.py every time our snake collides with the food, then not only are we going to refresh the food, but we're also going to get the snake to extend itself. So lets go ahead and run this game again. And notice how this time, once I hit the food, the snake actually extends itself and it gets longer each time. So now we're able to think about how to detect tail collision because as the snake gets longer, this tail collision becomes more of a problem. We're more likely to get tangled with our own tail. Let's go ahead and add a comment here which will say 'Detect collision with tail.' And the way that we want to check this is we wanna say if the head collides with any segment in the tail, then this means that we're going to trigger the game over sequence. So how can we detect if the head collides with any segment in the tail? Well, we could loop through our list of segments in the snake. So we could say for segment in snake.segments, so out of all the snakes segments, let's go through each one of them. And then we can say that well, if the snake.head has a distance of, let's say, I don't know, less than 10 from any of those segments that we're currently looping through, well that probably is a collision, right? So in that case, we're going to set the game_is_on to false and we're going to get the scoreboard to trigger the game over sequence. Now there's just one problem with this. If we go ahead and run the code as it is, you can see that immediately we get game over. And the reason is because out of all of the snake segments, the head is the first segment. So when we loop through each of the segments, the first segment is going to be the snake head. And so we're detecting if the snake head has a distance to the snake head of less than 10, which of course it is going to. So we need some sort of way of bypassing the snakehead. So we could say if the current segment that we're looping through is equal to, so double equal, to the snake.head, well, in this case, we're going to pass. But if this is not the case, so in the elif after the if statement, then we can check to see if the snake head has a distance to the segment of less than 10. Now, if we rerun this code, you'll see that it works exactly as we expect it to. We can move our snake around and as soon as the head hits the body, then it's game over for us. We've pretty much now completed the snake game. But in the next lesson, I want to talk about a special functionality in Python which is called slicing. And this is something that you will often see in code in the wild, and we'll use that to improve our code just a little bit more. So for all of that and more, I'll see you there. Now while our snake game works now with all of the functionality that we set out to create, there's just one thing that bothers me a little bit about this code, and it's how wordy this section is. All that we're trying to do is make sure that we're detecting the distance from all of the segments that we're looping through in snake.segments other than the first one. Surely there's an easier way of doing this rather than writing all of these lines of code. And indeed there is. But in order to use it, we have to learn about a Python concept known as slicing. Let's say that we had a list of piano keys all the way from a to g, and we wanted to get hold of a small section of this list. Let's say we wanted to slice the list so that we only get the c, d, and e keys from this list. How would we do that using Python? Well, one way of doing that is you could write a for loop and you could check, well, is it c, is a d, is it d. If so, then add it to a new list. But that's really convoluted. We have a much, much better way of doing that in Python. And it's known as slicing. This is what the syntax would look like. We would get hold of our lists, piano_keys, and then we would use a set of square brackets, but instead of accessing just one item with a position, we get a set of items by slicing it from position 2 to position 5. This might be a little bit confusing because we know that a is that position 0, b is at 1, c is at 2, but the one at position 5 is actually f, so how does this get us c, d, and e? Well, you have to visualize it like this. Imagine that zero position is actually at the beginning of the list before where a starts. And at the end of the list, we're actually at the slicing position of 7. If we think about it this way, then the way that we're slicing this list is going all the way from position 2 to position 5 then of course, we would end up with c, d, and e. If you take a look at this code in my Repl.it, I've essentially got the same code that we saw in the slides and we're slicing this list of piano keys from position 2 to 5. When I hit run, you will see that what gets printed is c, d, and e, exactly the slice that we wanted. Now, there's other things that you can do with slicing that's pretty cool. So, for example, if you wanted to slice from position 2, which remember is right here because we're starting at 0, 1, and 2, and you want to slice it all the way to the end of the list, well, you can just emit the second number. You can have two and then a colon. Now, when you slice this you get all of the rest of the list starting from the position that you specified. And this works in the opposite direction as well. Let's say that we want to get hold of everything up to position 5. Well, we could omit the first number, add a colon, and then after the colon specify the end slice position. And now we get all of the items in the list up to that position 5. In addition to just slicing between two numbers, we can actually specify a third number after another colon. And what this number does is it sets the increment. For example, we wanted the slice from a position 2 to position 5, but we want to only get every other item. So then it would give c, it would skip over the second one, and then it would give us e. And if I hit run, this is exactly what you see. So let's say I wanted to get hold of everything in this list but I wanted every second item. Well, then this is what my code would look like, go from the beginning to the end and then skip every second one. And I end up with a, c, e, and g. Now to extend this a little bit further, we can actually use this neat trick to specify a -1 as the increment and what this does is it will actually reverse this list for us going from right to the end to the beginning. So essentially the increments are by one, but it's by -1, so that way we get the list starting from the end all the way back to the beginning. And this is a really neat trick that you'll see a lot of people use when it comes to manipulating lists and tuples. So speaking of tuples, this method of slicing also works for tuples. So let's say we had a piano tuple, which remember is defined by a set of parentheses with items inside separated by commas. Well, we can use the same method of slicing to work with our tuple. So we use our square brackets, let's get hold of the items from section 2 to 5. Then when we hit run, you'll see it gives us mi, fa, so. So coming back to our code, I have a challenge for you. Can you figure out how to use what we've just learned about slicing to change this code so that we get rid of this if statement where we're passing over the snake head so that we are in fact only checking that the snake head has a distance to every segment other than the first segment, less than 10? If you managed successfully to do this, you should be able to get rid of this if statement, change this to a single if statement and somehow figure out a way of making this code work using slicing. Pause the video and give this a go. Alright, so we know that we want to loop through every segment in snake.segments other than the first one. Well, all we need to do is simply slice this list of segments. So we can get hold of everything that starts off from position 1 to the end, by writing 1:"

      "if we could also keep track of the high score. So if a user gets a score that's higher than the previous high score, then if they game over, then the high score is going to be updated so that we can keep trying to better ourselves at snake. And once we've learned all of those skills of manipulating file systems, reading and writing to file, then we're going to create a project that's going to save us a lot of hassle and automate our lives a little bit using Python. So the situation is let's say you need to write lots of letters. Maybe you having a birthday party, maybe you need to write wedding invites, or maybe you just need to email all your clients. Well, let's say that you wanted to personalize a part of that file say, for example, the part where you say dear name. Well, if you had a list of names and you wanted to create separate letters using each of those names, so maybe one that says 'Dear James', one that says 'Dear Emily' and then we just worked down the list and keep replacing parts of our letter with the names in our list. So we end up with a whole bunch of letters ready to send out. Depending on what kind of jobs you might have, this is something that could come in really handy as a part of your work or maybe just in your day to day lives. And we're going to get started using Python to automate parts of our lives, and get Python to do a lot of the repetitive tasks that we don't want to do. And so we can spend more time watching Netflix and playing video games. First, let's start by improving our snake game, getting it to be able to keep track of the high score that we attain each time we play the game so that we can see what our high score is and keep striving to better ourselves. Open up the snake game in PyCharm that you created a few days back. Now, if you can't find your snake game project, or if you've made some significant changes to it where it might be confusing to follow along with the tutorial, then simply just head over to this URL which is in the course resources and then you can go ahead and hit download as a zip, unzip the downloaded file, and then open it inside PyCharm and you should end up with the same project as I have here. And once you've done that, then we can begin to start adding the functionality to keep track of the high score. Firstly, I'm going to add another attribute to my scoreboard, which is going to be called high_score. And again, it's going to start out as zero. Now, the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to replace this game over method with a new method. We're not going to stop the game and write game over anymore. Instead, we're going to reset the scoreboard. So what happens when we reset the scoreboard? Well, we need to figure out if the current score that the user has attained is greater than the high score of all time. And if that is the case, then we're going to update the high score with the value of the current score. So the code for that would look something like this. If self.score is greater than self.high_score, well in that case then self.high_score is going to be equal to self.score. Now, this looks a little bit confusing at first, but if you just go through the logic and think about how you would create a high score saving mechanism, then you'll pretty quickly understand what's going on here. Now, once we've updated the high score, the next thing to do is to reset the score. So I'm going to reset it down to zero. Now, remember the order of your code matters a huge deal because if you first set the score to zero, then it's never going to be greater than the current high score. So this will never get triggered. So as always, be careful where you're writing your code. Now, after we've set the score, then we need to update the scoreboard. Now, one thing that I've changed about the scoreboard is previously when we increased the score, I've used the self.clear and then self.update_scoreboard. But it actually makes more sense for this clear to happen every single time we update the scoreboard. So I've added this method call here before we actually write the score. The reason why I couldn't do this previously is because when we wanted to show game over, we wanted to keep the score on the screen and then for the score board turtle to go to the center and write game over so that both of these things show up on screen. But now that we're getting rid of our game over method, then we can go ahead and move that clear to update scoreboard and then we don't have to call it twice, both in reset and increase_score. Now, in addition to writing the score, I'm now also going to write the high score, and this is going to be using an f-string to insert self.high_score. Now, if we run this game as it is, you can see it says score 0, high score 0 using these initial values. But as soon as it hits the wall, it ends because in our main.py we change this game_is_on to false and that ends our while loop. Instead, what I'm going to do is I'm going to delete this game_is_on equals false and also delete it when we collide with the tail. And I'm also going to delete the part where we call game over from the score board. Instead, I'm going to get the scoreboard to reset itself. So that way the score gets reset to zero and we're ready with the next round. So now if I run this game again, you can see it says, score is 0, and then as soon as we get a higher score and we end up dying, like so, then our high score goes to 2. But our snake kind of just disappears because it continues moving in the same direction and it's now probably somewhere, all the way down to the left. What we do instead? Well, our snake also needs to be reset. So let's create a reset method inside the snake class as well. And all we're going to do is we're going to get all of the segments to clear. And when I hover over this clear, you can see what it does is it's going to remove all of the items from that list. So all of the segments that we've added already to the list of segments is going to be deleted. And then once we've gotten rid of all the segments, we're going to call self.create_snake again, so that we create another three-segment snake in the starting position. Now, in addition, I'm also going to set the self.head as the zeroth element from that list of segments. So basically we're doing everything that is in the init because we're going to initialize the snake again, back at the center. So now if I go back to main.py, and in addition to resetting the scoreboard, I also get my snake to reset, Right? At this point, when I run the code, you'll notice that it's not behaving quite the way you expect it to. So I can go ahead and score, and when I die, I get the high score, but my old snake is still lingering on screen. So even though we've cleared the segments, we don't actually get rid of the turtles that are still onscreen. And in order to get rid of them, we actually have to send them to a different location. In our snake reset method, just before we clear our segments, so while we still have access to all of them, we're going to use a for loop to loop through all of the segments in the list of segments and tell each of them to go to a place that is off the screen. So our screen is only 600 by 600 and I'm going to tell it to go to 1000 X, 1000 Y. So it's gonna disappear off the screen. So this way, notice how when the snake hits one of the walls or when it hits its tail, instead of sort of just staying there, it actually disappears into a location that's off the screen. So that way we can keep track of our high scores, we can continue to get higher scores, and if we get a score that's not quite as high as the high score and we end up dying, then the high score stays as the previous value. Now, the only thing about this game is that in order to end it, we have to hit the stop button here. But once we've done that, it also reveals the crucial flaw in our code. Because if I run our program again, you can see that, wait, what happened to the high score, right? We had a high score of 3 previously. So, huh? What exactly is happening? Well, the reason is actually quite simple. We know that if we create a variable, let's say we create a variable called a set it to equal three, and then at some point we set a to be from the input. So now when I run this code, you can see that initially a is equal to three, but then the next line I asked the user, 'what do you want a to equals?' I'm going to make it equal to 12. Now at this point, if I go ahead and access this variable a inside the console just by typing a and then hitting enter, you can see it's equal to 12. Now, similarly, I can add some print statements here. I can print the value of a and then also print the value of a after we modify it. So again, you can see initially it's equal to 3, but then I decided to change it to 12. So now it's equal to 12. Now what happens if I rerun the code. A is equal to three aain. Its reset itself because the code is being rerun and the previous state is not being remembered. In our case, we've got this high score variable which initially starts out as zero. And at some point during the game as we progress, we modify this high score variable to equal a new value, let's say three. So now if I go ahead and print my high score, you can see that it's equal to 3. But as soon as I rerun the code and this goes through, then all of that progress gets reset. And now if I print the value of high score, you can see it's again, equal to zero. So this is what's happening in our program as well. So how might you keep track of the score if you weren't using Python? Well, you might open up a word document and then write down your high score in that document, close it down, and then the next time you play the game, open up that file again and see what your previous high score is. We're going to try and do the same thing, but using Python to read and write to a file so that we can save our progress and be able to retrieve our previous high scores each time we play the snake game. To find out how to do that and to solve this problem, head over to the next lesson and we'll talk about how to use Python to open, read, write, and close files on your system. In this lesson, I want to talk about the file system and how you could use Python to open up files, read files, write to the files, and also close them down again, all without touching the mouse. So that way we can start saving our high scores into a file and retrieve it the next time we open up our program. Let's start out by trying to do some of the simplest things with a file, reading and writing. Now I've created a new project using PyCharm called day-24, and I've created my main.py where we're going to write our Python code. But in addition, I'm also going to create a new file which is going to be called my_file.txt. So this is going to be a text file. Now, inside this text file, I'm going to write some text. Hello, my name is Angela. And if you want, you can actually find this text file inside your project folder, and you can actually open it up with your native text editing software. So TextEdit on Mac or Notepad on Windows. And you can see it's just a bunch of text. There's nothing really special here. But what we can do using Python is that we can actually open up that file. So, notice how this method, open, is a inbuilt method. So you don't have to import anything, you can use it directly. And it takes a number of inputs; the file that you want to open, the mode that you want to open that file in, and a whole bunch of other optional things that you can specify. In our case, I'm going to specify the name of my file as a string, so my_file.txt. So remember that extension. And then I'm going to open this file and I'm going to save it inside a variable called file. So when we hit run right now, nothing's really going to happen. You're not going to see anything happening, but behind the scenes, Python has already opened up this file and its ready for the next operation that you might want to do on that file. So the next thing I wanna do is I wanna read the file and this read method returns the contents of that file as a string. So we can now save it inside a variable called contents and I can go ahead and print out this contents. So when I hit run right now, you can see what gets printed out is the content from my_file.txt. And if I go ahead and modify my file to add some more lines and I hit run again, you can see that all of the lines are being printed once we've opened the file, we've read the file, and we print the contents that we have read. At the end of all of our work, what we have to do once we're done with that file that we've opened we also have to close it. If there's an open, there's probably going to be a close. Now, why do we need to close the file? Well, once Python opens up that file, it basically takes up some of the resources of your computer. And at some point later on, it might decide to close it and free up those resources, but we don't know when that's going to happen and if it will happen. So instead, we're going to tell it to close down the file manually using this line of code. It's a similar concept to having lots and lots of tabs open in your browser. While it's kind of convenient to have all of these tabs open, if you actually want your computer to perform at its best you actually want to only use as many tabs as you need. Every extra tab is going to add a little bit of burden to your computer and especially if you're using a very heavy application like Chrome which likes to take up a lot of resources of your CPU and your computer. If you have more than 20 or 30 tabs, you'll notice a significant decrease in the speed of your computer. So here's a computer tip as well as Programming tip, always close down tabs that you've opened and always close out on files that you've opened. Now because it's kind of hard to remember to close a file because we might be doing lots of other things in between the open and close, right? We might be writing to the file, we might be modifying it or reading it line by line or doing lots of different things. So instead, what many Python developers opt for is a different way of opening the file. We can use a 'with' keyword. And 'with' we can open this file and then we can open it as whatever it is we decide to name. So this you can name to anything. You can name it as f, you can name it as file. It's basically the equivalent to that variable that we created earlier on which stored the opened file. Now we can indent the rest of this and I can delete this file.close. And you can see that it works exactly the same as before, but now we no longer have to remember to close our file just by adding some keywords here. This 'with' keyword is going to manage that file directly. So as soon as it notices that we're done with it, it'll close down the file. It kinda makes me wish that something similar for tabs existed, but let's get back to our Python code. So now that we've opened up my_file.txt, we've saved into a variable called file, we've read that file and saved the contents that we read into a variable called contents, and then we've printed it. Now, what if instead of reading the file, I wanted to write to it? Well, it's just as simple. So we can get hold of our file and then call write. And we can put any sort of string inside this write method to put into our file. So let's put some text, let's call it new text. And I want this new text to be written into my_file.txt. And if we run the code as it is, you'll notice that it doesn't work cause it says that unsupported operation, this file is not writable. And this is because we opened up the file in read-only mode. So remember when we took a look at some of the parameters for this method open, one of them was called mode and by default, it's set to read-only, so 'r.' Now if we want to write to it, so make it editable, we have the change, the mode to 'w' for write. So now if I run the code again, you can see that process finished with exit code zero which we know to mean that everything was successful. And if I take a look inside my_file.txt, all of the previous text got magically deleted and replaced with the new text that I wanted to write. Now, if you don't want to delete everything that is in the file but you just want to add to it, then you can change this mode from 'w' to 'a' and 'a' stands for append. So just as we like to use list.append and then we can add something to the end of the list, well, the same thing happens with appending and writing. So I can write my new text and I can add a new line, remember we can use \\n to add a new line, and then add the new text. And now take a look at the after version when I hit run and we write this new line and new text by appending it to my file. It's gone at the very end of the file here. Now, one of the important things you need to know when you're writing files is when you try to open a file in write mode and that file doesn't exist, then it's going to actually create it for you from scratch. So let's go ahead and create a file which I'll call new_file.txt, make sure you've got the extension in there. And we have the mode as write set. Because this new_file.txt doesn't exist in this folder, then it's actually going to create it for us. So now when I hit run, you can see that once this goes through, that new file gets created and the new text has been written inside. Now, remember this only works when you're in the write mode and when that file doesn't currently exist. So those are some basic ways of working with the file system. We can open and read, we can open and write. And by using these different modes, append, read, or write, we can define what it is that we want to do with that file that we've opened. Now that we've learned how to work with the file system, in the next lesson I want to show you how we can fix our snake game so that we can write to a text file our high score. And every time we open up and run our game, we fetch that file and see what the previous high score was so that we can load it into our game. So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson. It's time for your challenge. You've already seen how we've managed to get the snake game to keep track of the high score. And when the user scores a number that's greater than the high score, then we replace that high score with the new value. But unfortunately as you saw previously, at the moment when we run this game and we achieve a new high score, the next time that we run the game again that is completely lost. So the first thing I want you to do is to right click on your project, create a new file and call it data.txt. So we're going to create a data text file. Now this data text file is just going to contain a single number, zero. And we're going to use the data that's in this data.txt file to keep track of the high score. And it's your job to figure out how you can convert this simple attribute here, high score, to instead of using a number that we've just created in the code, I want you to use the number that's inside data.txt. So you'll need to read from it here and then later on, you'll need to write to it when we reset the game and check if there is a new high score. Everything going well, you should be able to run the game, achieve a new high score and then stop and rerun the game and still see that high score showing up. Think about what you learned in the last lesson, have a think about how you can convert the text in here into a number using what you've learned in previous lessons and pause the video and give this challenge a go. All right. So we know that we've already got this file, data.txt, and it already contains the number zero. So instead of using this line of code, we're going to be reading from that file to get that zero. Let's delete this line of code. And instead, I'm going to open my file with the file name that is data.txt. And the file name is, of course, a string like you see here wrapped in quotation marks, and we're going to use the with keywords so that we don't have to bother about closing the file again. We can get Python to manage it for us. with opening this file, and I'm going to save that file to a variable called data. Now I'm going to use that data and read from it. Now, once I've read from it, I should end up with some sort of string that's going to represent the contents of this file. So that string will need to be converted to an integer if we want to use it as a number which we can increase and change in our game. So I'm going to type convert it into an integer. And then finally, I'm going to save that as the value for our new attribute, self.high_score. That's the reading part done and if we run our code as it is, it should already work as it did before, but it won't have the feature that we want which is to be able to quit out of the game, stop and rerun. So it still not saving the latest high score to that data.txt. You can see it's still zero. So where do we want to save it? Well, it's got to happen every time we adjust the high score. When the score is greater than the current high score, we set the high score to the new score. But in addition, we're going to read from a file data.txt. So let's use our syntax with, and then open, again, and let's pass in the name of our file, data.txt. And remember that we also need to change the mode to 'w' for write because otherwise, it's not going to let us write to that file. Now, once we've opened it and we've saved it as a variable called data, then we can write to that data using data.write. And what are we going to write to it? Well, we have to write a string. So let's use an f-string to convert our current self.high_score into a string, and then write that into our file, data.txt. Now notice what happens when I run my code. So I'm going to achieve a new high score of, um, 2, which I'm very proud of. And now if I hit stop, take a look at data.txt. It's been updated, it's been rewritten by these two lines of code. So now if I rerun my program, you can see it already is showing my previous high score of 2, and I can keep playing this game and accumulate my high score and all of that data will be saved to my file data.txt, like that. So did you manage to get this right? And by the way, if you see this keyboard interrupt, don't worry. That's just because we clicked on the stop button to stop our program because it wants to keep on going forever until we achieve the highest score of them all. The point of this exercise is to try and get you to review what we learned in the last lesson, which is opening a file, reading the file, and also writing to the file and remembering the mode that we have to change. And hopefully, you'll start to see how this could be really useful in terms of improving the usability of our programs in our games. Now in the next lesson, we're going to talk more than just about files. We're going to talk about file paths and directories. So for all of that and more, I'll see you there. All right. So we've seen how we can open and close files as well as read them and write to them. But files don't just have a name. They also have a path or a way of getting to them. For example, here in this map, if we wanted this dinosaur to get to the golden egg, there's many paths that it could take. But if we wanted to give it some directions as to how it might arrive on this path, well we might say, you know, continue forwards at the volcano turn, right. And then when you see a snake turn right again, and when you see the coconut tree turn left and you will get to the cave with the egg. Now on computers, it works quite similarly, but we have to remember that on the computer there's files and there's folders. So files can live within folders and you can navigate through several folders deep in order to get to a particular file. So let's think about what the file paths might be for a computer that has a structure that looks like this. So the first thing to note is that at the very root of all of the files and the folders is basically the origin, right? This is the root folder. And on a Mac, you can see that our PyCharm projects live within my users folder, inside a folder called users inside a folder called Macintosh HD. So if I have this folder selected right here, I can say go to enclosing folder, which is this one. And then if I keep doing this, you can see it keeps jumping up until it can go no further. So the root on a Mac is the Macintosh HD, the hard drive. And that in terms of a path is represented by a single forward slash. Now when you're on a Windows computer however, the root folder is usually your C drive. So that becomes your root folder. Inside our root folder, our Macintosh HD or a C drive, we have a folder called work. Inside that folder I've got a report Word document as well as a project folder. And then inside that project folder, there's a PowerPoint called talk. Now, if we think about the file paths for each of these things, this is what they might look like. The route is obviously just a /, the work folder will be /work, report will be /work/ report.doc, project will be /work/project, and finally, the talk will be /work/project/talk. ppt. So this path is kind of like the direction that we were talking about previously. It's a way for the computer to navigate to the file of interest which in this case might be the talk.ppt. And we have to give it directions for which folder to go into and then which folder, and then you'll find the file with this name. Now, this is known as an absolute file path. Absolute file paths always start off relative to the root. So you always see a forward slash to begin with, and sometimes you'll see C: or on a Mac you'll just see the /. This absolute file path is basically a path that starts from the origin, the route of the computer storage system. Now there's also something called a relative file path. Taking this talk.ppt, we know that the absolute file path is /work/project/ talk.ppt. But what if we were actually inside this project folder? So let's say that at the time when we're trying to get to this talk.ppt we're actually right here. Now this, in computer-speak, is called the working directory. It's basically the directory or folder that we're currently working from. And once we've established a working directory, say that we are right here, then we can use what's called a relative file path to get to a file that we're interested in. So given that we're here and we're trying to get here, the relative file path is simply just ./talk.ppt. The ./ signifies look in the current folder for this file. If we switch up our working directory and let's say we are now working from the work folder, how do we get to this talk.ppt? Well, the absolute file path would not change for this file, but the relative file path would now be ./project/talk.ppt. So we're walking from here to here to here. Now, what if we wanted to go upwards in the directory tree? Let's say we wanted to get a hold of this report.doc, but we all currently working inside this project folder. How do we go one step up? Well, we would right .., so two dots now, /report.doc. So we're inside this project folder, we're coming out of it to the parent folder which is the work folder, and then we're getting hold of this file. So that two dots represents going one step up in the hierarchy to the parent folder, which this case is the work folder. Now what we've been doing is we've been writing code inside our main.py. And that main.py has usually been inside some sort of project folder. When we're trying to get hold of a file this is basically where we are at. So our working directory is the work folder. So that means if we wanted to get access to this report.doc file from our main.py, all we need to do is write ./report.doc because we're working within the same directory and we're just getting hold of this file. Now, when you're using relative file path, you can use this ./ but you can also shorten it and get rid of it as well. This is why we've been able to open this my_file.txt which is in the same folder as my main.py and notice how these two files are at the same hierarchical level. So let's do a quick challenge. I'm going to delete the part where we write to the file and I'm going to change my file so it just has one sentence and I'm going to locate this file by using 'Reveal in Finder' and on Windows that would be right- click and Show in Explorer. And it would show you the location of that file in your computer system. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to move this file to the desktop. Right? And what I want you to do is I want you to go to the desktop, right- click on that file. And if you want a Mac, I want you to click on get info. And if you are on a Windows, I want you to right-click and go to properties. Now what you're looking for is this location here. Now you can see that this current file, new_file, is located under the root folder, which in this case is the C:\\Users\\London AppBrewery\\Desktop\\new_file.txt. On a Mac you can see that it's located under the root folder, which is Macintosh HD slash users slash Angela slash desktop slash my_file. txt. Here comes your challenge. Now that we've moved our file away from our project, I want you to fix this code so that when you run it, it won't give you this file not found error because at the moment there is no my_ file.txt in the same working directory as our main.py. It doesn't exist inside this folder. Have a think about what you've learned so far and see if you can change this path so that our code works again. And it's the same on Windows. Use the location of the file on your computer and use the absolute path in the code to get it to work. Pause the video now. Okay All right. Here's how you would use the absolute path. So we know that our, my_file.txt is located in the root folder and then it's users, angela, desktop. So let's go ahead and change this string. Let's start at the root and then let's add the next folder, which is users. And then let's add another slash and then we go to the next folder, which is Angela. Now of course, this will be different for you, but finally we go to our desktop and then we can get to our, my_file.txt. So this is the full path to get to this file. So now if I run this code again, you can see it's able to read the file, there is no errors, and it's getting hold of the contents of the file. Now on Windows, it's a similar story. So we know that the location of the file is root, then users, then LondonAppBrewery, then desktop. Again, this of course will be different for you depending on your username, but you should see it in your location when you take a look at the file properties. So let's change this. Let's start out at the root, which is the C drive, and then let's go to users. And then we go to our username which is LondonAppBrewery , and then we go to our desktop and that is where it should find this new_file. txt. So now when I hit run, you can see that it's able to fetch that file and print the content without any errors. Now, one of the peculiarities about file paths in Windows and Mac is that in a Mac, the path, each of the folders are separated by a / whereas on Windows, they're separated by a \\. But as you've noticed, when we're writing Python code, we don't care about that. We can just write it as / and making sure that we have the root, which represents the C drive, so this entire part, and then we have our folder, the next folder, the next folder, the next folder, et cetera. So now comes the next challenge. You can see that this path follows from the root folder, which is the C drive and on the Mac, it's also from the Macintosh HD. So what if we wanted to change this so that it's relative to our current main .py? Our main.py if we go to 'Show in Explorer', you can see that the path for this file is the following. It's under Users/LondonAppBrewery/PyCharmProjects/WindowsDemo. So that's the name of my project. And then afterwards, it's my main.py. So this is a bit of a tricky question. Given that this file is inside this current folder or whatever it is that you have as your folder which contains this file, how can you get it to use a relative file path so that it jumps back two folders to the LondonAppBrewery folder and then goes to Desktop and then to new file? On our Mac, it's a similar story. So we go to 'Reveal in Finder'. We can see this is where we are currently. So our current working directory is this day-24 project folder. So if we go one level up and the shortcut is command + up, we go to our day-24 folder. So this is our working directory. Now, if we want to go up one level, we can go to go, and then go to including folder, so one level up that gets us to PyCharm projects. And then if we go one level up further, we get to our Angela folder at which point we can then navigate downwards to Desktop/my_file.txt. This is your challenge. Figure out what the relative path to the text file on your desktop should be then modify the code and get it to work. Pause the video now. The way that we would modify this is in order to get to this Angela folder where we can continue to our Desktop and then to my file, we have to go up two levels. So that translates to ../../ and now we're inside the Angela folder. So we can start going down. And PyCharm is smart enough to know what your folder structure looks like. So it will start giving you hints as to what folders are accessible at this level. So I can get to Desktop and then I can get to my_file.txt. And if I go ahead and run my code, you can see it's able to read and print the content of that file. The main difference between an absolute file path and a relative file path is the absolute file path is always relative to the root of your computer. On Windows that's the C drive, usually anyways unless you've changed it. And on a Mac, it is the Macintosh HD. Now the relative file path is relative to your current working directory. So it depends on where you are and where you're trying to get to. Now, depending on the situation and where that file you are interested in is located, you might decide to use the absolute file path or the relative file path. And you can see that in this case it's not necessarily that much shorter or that much more easier to understand. So if you know how to do both, then you can adapt to the situation and figure out which one is most appropriate. Now I know that paths can be confusing. So that's why I've come up with a whole bunch of quiz exercises for you in the next lesson for you to get more the practice with file paths so that you can feel confident leaving this lesson. So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson. All right, guys, it's time to put what you've learned to the test. Now in this project, we're going to be doing a little bit of mail merging. So mail merging is where you take something like what we have a list of names, for example, and we want to insert each of these names into a letter. So instead of saying dear [name], you are invited to my birthday the Saturday, it should say dear and then it would replace that with whatever is here. Take a look at this example file. You can see that it replaced the name placeholder with the first name in the invited_names.txt file. Your objective is to write some python code to automate the process. So what you're going to end up with is a bunch of letters, one for each of the names inside the invited_ names.txt and the letters are going to be named like this:",
      "for you in ",
      "while loop. Instead, what I'm going to do is I'm going to delete this game_is_on equals false and also delete it when we collide with the tail. And I'm also going to delete the part where we call game over from the score board. Instead, I'm going to get the scoreboard to reset itself. So that way the score gets reset to zero and we're ready with the next round. So now if I run this game again, you can see it says, score is 0, and then as soon as we get a higher score and we end up dying, like so, then our high score goes to 2. But our snake kind of just disappears because it continues moving in the same direction and it's now probably somewhere, all the way down to the left. What we do instead? Well, our snake also needs to be reset. So let's create a reset method inside the snake class as well. And all we're going to do is we're going to get all of the segments to clear. And when I hover over this clear, you can see what it does is it's going to remove all of the items from that list. So all of the segments that we've added already to the list of segments is going to be deleted. And then once we've gotten rid of all the segments, we're going to call self.create_snake again, so that we create another three-segment snake in the starting position. Now, in addition, I'm also going to set the self.head as the zeroth element from that list of segments. So basically we're doing everything that is in the init because we're going to initialize the snake again, back at the center. So now if I go back to main.py, and in addition to resetting the scoreboard, I also get my snake to reset, Right? At this point, when I run the code, you'll notice that it's not behaving quite the way you expect it to. So I can go ahead and score, and when I die, I get the high score, but my old snake is still lingering on screen. So even though we've cleared the segments, we don't actually get rid of the turtles that are still onscreen. And in order to get rid of them, we actually have to send them to a different location. In our snake reset method, just before we clear our segments, so while we still have access to all of them, we're going to use a for loop to loop through all of the segments in the list of segments and tell each of them to go to a place that is off the screen. So our screen is only 600 by 600 and I'm going to tell it to go to 1000 X, 1000 Y. So it's gonna disappear off the screen. So this way, notice how when the snake hits one of the walls or when it hits its tail, instead of sort of just staying there, it actually disappears into a location that's off the screen. So that way we can keep track of our high scores, we can continue to get higher scores, and if we get a score that's not quite as high as the high score and we end up dying, then the high score stays as the previous value. Now, the only thing about this game is that in order to end it, we have to hit the stop button here. But once we've done that, it also reveals the crucial flaw in our code. Because if I run our program again, you can see that, wait, what happened to the high score, right? We had a high score of 3 previously. So, huh? What exactly is happening? Well, the reason is actually quite simple. We know that if we create a variable, let's say we create a variable called a set it to equal three, and then at some point we set a to be from the input. So now when I run this code, you can see that initially a is equal to three, but then the next line I asked the user, 'what do you want a to equals?' I'm going to make it equal to 12. Now at this point, if I go ahead and access this variable a inside the console just by typing a and then hitting enter, you can see it's equal to 12. Now, similarly, I can add some print statements here. I can print the value of a and then also print the value of a after we modify it. So again, you can see initially it's equal to 3, but then I decided to change it to 12. So now it's equal to 12. Now what happens if I rerun the code. A is equal to three aain. Its reset itself because the code is being rerun and the previous state is not being remembered. In our case, we've got this high score variable which initially starts out as zero. And at some point during the game as we progress, we modify this high score variable to equal a new value, let's say three. So now if I go ahead and print my high score, you can see that it's equal to 3. But as soon as I rerun the code and this goes through, then all of that progress gets reset. And now if I print the value of high score, you can see it's again, equal to zero. So this is what's happening in our program as well. So how might you keep track of the score if you weren't using Python? Well, you might open up a word document and then write down your high score in that document, close it down, and then the next time you play the game, open up that file again and see what your previous high score is. We're going to try and do the same thing, but using Python to read and write to a file so that we can save our progress and be able to retrieve our previous high scores each time we play the snake game. To find out how to do that and to solve this problem, head over to the next lesson and we'll talk about how to use Python to open, read, write, and close files on your system. In this lesson, I want to talk about the file system and how you could use Python to open up files, read files, write to the files, and also close them down again, all without touching the mouse. So that way we can start saving our high scores into a file and retrieve it the next time we open up our program. Let's start out by trying to do some of the simplest things with a file, reading and writing. Now I've created a new project using PyCharm called day-24, and I've created my main.py where we're going to write our Python code. But in addition, I'm also going to create a new file which is going to be called my_file.txt. So this is going to be a text file. Now, inside this text file, I'm going to write some text. Hello, my name is Angela. And if you want, you can actually find this text file inside your project folder, and you can actually open it up with your native text editing software. So TextEdit on Mac or Notepad on Windows. And you can see it's just a bunch of text. There's nothing really special here. But what we can do using Python is that we can actually open up that file. So, notice how this method, open, is a inbuilt method. So you don't have to import anything, you can use it directly. And it takes a number of inputs; the file that you want to open, the mode that you want to open that file in, and a whole bunch of other optional things that you can specify. In our case, I'm going to specify the name of my file as a string, so my_file.txt. So remember that extension. And then I'm going to open this file and I'm going to save it inside a variable called file. So when we hit run right now, nothing's really going to happen. You're not going to see anything happening, but behind the scenes, Python has already opened up this file and its ready for the next operation that you might want to do on that file. So the next thing I wanna do is I wanna read the file and this read method returns the contents of that file as a string. So we can now save it inside a variable called contents and I can go ahead and print out this contents. So when I hit run right now, you can see what gets printed out is the content from my_file.txt. And if I go ahead and modify my file to add some more lines and I hit run again, you can see that all of the lines are being printed once we've opened the file, we've read the file, and we print the contents that we have read. At the end of all of our work, what we have to do once we're done with that file that we've opened we also have to close it. If there's an open, there's probably going to be a close. Now, why do we need to close the file? Well, once Python opens up that file, it basically takes up some of the resources of your computer. And at some point later on, it might decide to close it and free up those resources, but we don't know when that's going to happen and if it will happen. So instead, we're going to tell it to close down the file manually using this line of code. It's a similar concept to having lots and lots of tabs open in your browser. While it's kind of convenient to have all of these tabs open, if you actually want your computer to perform at its best you actually want to only use as many tabs as you need. Every extra tab is going to add a little bit of burden to your computer and especially if you're using a very heavy application like Chrome which likes to take up a lot of resources of your CPU and your computer. If you have more than 20 or 30 tabs, you'll notice a significant decrease in the speed of your computer. So here's a computer tip as well as Programming tip, always close down tabs that you've opened and always close out on files that you've opened. Now because it's kind of hard to remember to close a file because we might be doing lots of other things in between the open and close, right? We might be writing to the file, we might be modifying it or reading it line by line or doing lots of different things. So instead, what many Python developers opt for is a different way of opening the file. We can use a 'with' keyword. And 'with' we can open this file and then we can open it as whatever it is we decide to name. So this you can name to anything. You can name it as f, you can name it as file. It's basically the equivalent to that variable that we created earlier on which stored the opened file. Now we can indent the rest of this and I can delete this file.close. And you can see that it works exactly the same as before, but now we no longer have to remember to close our file just by adding some keywords here. This 'with' keyword is going to manage that file directly. So as soon as it notices that we're done with it, it'll close down the file. It kinda makes me wish that something similar for tabs existed, but let's get back to our Python code. So now that we've opened up my_file.txt, we've saved into a variable called file, we've read that file and saved the contents that we read into a variable called contents, and then we've printed it. Now, what if instead of reading the file, I wanted to write to it? Well, it's just as simple. So we can get hold of our file and then call write. And we can put any sort of string inside this write method to put into our file. So let's put some text, let's call it new text. And I want this new text to be written into my_file.txt. And if we run the code as it is, you'll notice that it doesn't work cause it says that unsupported operation, this file is not writable. And this is because we opened up the file in read-only mode. So remember when we took a look at some of the parameters for this method open, one of them was called mode and by default, it's set to read-only, so 'r.' Now if we want to write to it, so make it editable, we have the change, the mode to 'w' for write. So now if I run the code again, you can see that process finished with exit code zero which we know to mean that everything was successful. And if I take a look inside my_file.txt, all of the previous text got magically deleted and replaced with the new text that I wanted to write. Now, if you don't want to delete everything that is in the file but you just want to add to it, then you can change this mode from 'w' to 'a' and 'a' stands for append. So just as we like to use list.append and then we can add something to the end of the list, well, the same thing happens with appending and writing. So I can write my new text and I can add a new line, remember we can use \\n to add a new line, and then add the new text. And now take a look at the after version when I hit run and we write this new line and new text by appending it to my file. It's gone at the very end of the file here. Now, one of the important things you need to know when you're writing files is when you try to open a file in write mode and that file doesn't exist, then it's going to actually create it for you from scratch. So let's go ahead and create a file which I'll call new_file.txt, make sure you've got the extension in there. And we have the mode as write set. Because this new_file.txt doesn't exist in this folder, then it's actually going to create it for us. So now when I hit run, you can see that once this goes through, that new file gets created and the new text has been written inside. Now, remember this only works when you're in the write mode and when that file doesn't currently exist. So those are some basic ways of working with the file system. We can open and read, we can open and write. And by using these different modes, append, read, or write, we can define what it is that we want to do with that file that we've opened. Now that we've learned how to work with the file system, in the next lesson I want to show you how we can fix our snake game so that we can write to a text file our high score. And every time we open up and run our game, we fetch that file and see what the previous high score was so that we can load it into our game. So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson. It's time for your challenge. You've already seen how we've managed to get the snake game to keep track of the high score. And when the user scores a number that's greater than the high score, then we replace that high score with the new value. But unfortunately as you saw previously, at the moment when we run this game and we achieve a new high score, the next time that we run the game again that is completely lost. So the first thing I want you to do is to right click on your project, create a new file and call it data.txt. So we're going to create a data text file. Now this data text file is just going to contain a single number, zero. And we're going to use the data that's in this data.txt file to keep track of the high score. And it's your job to figure out how you can convert this simple attribute here, high score, to instead of using a number that we've just created in the code, I want you to use the number that's inside data.txt. So you'll need to read from it here and then later on, you'll need to write to it when we reset the game and check if there is a new high score. Everything going well, you should be able to run the game, achieve a new high score and then stop and rerun the game and still see that high score showing up. Think about what you learned in the last lesson, have a think about how you can convert the text in here into a number using what you've learned in previous lessons and pause the video and give this challenge a go. All right. So we know that we've already got this file, data.txt, and it already contains the number zero. So instead of using this line of code, we're going to be reading from that file to get that zero. Let's delete this line of code. And instead, I'm going to open my file with the file name that is data.txt. And the file name is, of course, a string like you see here wrapped in quotation marks, and we're going to use the with keywords so that we don't have to bother about closing the file again. We can get Python to manage it for us. with opening this file, and I'm going to save that file to a variable called data. Now I'm going to use that data and read from it. Now, once I've read from it, I should end up with some sort of string that's going to represent the contents of this file. So that string will need to be converted to an integer if we want to use it as a number which we can increase and change in our game. So I'm going to type convert it into an integer. And then finally, I'm going to save that as the value for our new attribute, self.high_score. That's the reading part done and if we run our code as it is, it should already work as it did before, but it won't have the feature that we want which is to be able to quit out of the game, stop and rerun. So it still not saving the latest high score to that data.txt. You can see it's still zero. So where do we want to save it? Well, it's got to happen every time we adjust the high score. When the score is greater than the current high score, we set the high score to the new score. But in addition, we're going to read from a file data.txt. So let's use our syntax with, and then open, again, and let's pass in the name of our file, data.txt. And remember that we also need to change the mode to 'w' for write because otherwise, it's not going to let us write to that file. Now, once we've opened it and we've saved it as a variable called data, then we can write to that data using data.write. And what are we going to write to it? Well, we have to write a string. So let's use an f-string to convert our current self.high_score into a string, and then write that into our file, data.txt. Now notice what happens when I run my code. So I'm going to achieve a new high score of, um, 2, which I'm very proud of. And now if I hit stop, take a look at data.txt. It's been updated, it's been rewritten by these two lines of code. So now if I rerun my program, you can see it already is showing my previous high score of 2, and I can keep playing this game and accumulate my high score and all of that data will be saved to my file data.txt, like that. So did you manage to get this right? And by the way, if you see this keyboard interrupt, don't worry. That's just because we clicked on the stop button to stop our program because it wants to keep on going forever until we achieve the highest score of them all. The point of this exercise is to try and get you to review what we learned in the last lesson, which is opening a file, reading the file, and also writing to the file and remembering the mode that we have to change. And hopefully, you'll start to see how this could be really useful in terms of improving the usability of our programs in our games. Now in the next lesson, we're going to talk more than just about files. We're going to talk about file paths and directories. So for all of that and more, I'll see you there. All right. So we've seen how we can open and close files as well as read them and write to them. But files don't just have a name. They also have a path or a way of getting to them. For example, here in this map, if we wanted this dinosaur to get to the golden egg, there's many paths that it could take. But if we wanted to give it some directions as to how it might arrive on this path, well we might say, you know, continue forwards at the volcano turn, right. And then when you see a snake turn right again, and when you see the coconut tree turn left and you will get to the cave with the egg. Now on computers, it works quite similarly, but we have to remember that on the computer there's files and there's folders. So files can live within folders and you can navigate through several folders deep in order to get to a particular file. So let's think about what the file paths might be for a computer that has a structure that looks like this. So the first thing to note is that at the very root of all of the files and the folders is basically the origin, right? This is the root folder. And on a Mac, you can see that our PyCharm projects live within my users folder, inside a folder called users inside a folder called Macintosh HD. So if I have this folder selected right here, I can say go to enclosing folder, which is this one. And then if I keep doing this, you can see it keeps jumping up until it can go no further. So the root on a Mac is the Macintosh HD, the hard drive. And that in terms of a path is represented by a single forward slash. Now when you're on a Windows computer however, the root folder is usually your C drive. So that becomes your root folder. Inside our root folder, our Macintosh HD or a C drive, we have a folder called work. Inside that folder I've got a report Word document as well as a project folder. And then inside that project folder, there's a PowerPoint called talk. Now, if we think about the file paths for each of these things, this is what they might look like. The route is obviously just a /, the work folder will be /work, report will be /work/ report.doc, project will be /work/project, and finally, the talk will be /work/project/talk. ppt. So this path is kind of like the direction that we were talking about previously. It's a way for the computer to navigate to the file of interest which in this case might be the talk.ppt. And we have to give it directions for which folder to go into and then which folder, and then you'll find the file with this name. Now, this is known as an absolute file path. Absolute file paths always start off relative to the root. So you always see a forward slash to begin with, and sometimes you'll see C: or on a Mac you'll just see the /. This absolute file path is basically a path that starts from the origin, the route of the computer storage system. Now there's also something called a relative file path. Taking this talk.ppt, we know that the absolute file path is /work/project/ talk.ppt. But what if we were actually inside this project folder? So let's say that at the time when we're trying to get to this talk.ppt we're actually right here. Now this, in computer-speak, is called the working directory. It's basically the directory or folder that we're currently working from. And once we've established a working directory, say that we are right here, then we can use what's called a relative file path to get to a file that we're interested in. So given that we're here and we're trying to get here, the relative file path is simply just ./talk.ppt. The ./ signifies look in the current folder for this file. If we switch up our working directory and let's say we are now working from the work folder, how do we get to this talk.ppt? Well, the absolute file path would not change for this file, but the relative file path would now be ./project/talk.ppt. So we're walking from here to here to here. Now, what if we wanted to go upwards in the directory tree? Let's say we wanted to get a hold of this report.doc, but we all currently working inside this project folder. How do we go one step up? Well, we would right .., so two dots now, /report.doc. So we're inside this project folder, we're coming out of it to the parent folder which is the work folder, and then we're getting hold of this file. So that two dots represents going one step up in the hierarchy to the parent folder, which this case is the work folder. Now what we've been doing is we've been writing code inside our main.py. And that main.py has usually been inside some sort of project folder. When we're trying to get hold of a file this is basically where we are at. So our working directory is the work folder. So that means if we wanted to get access to this report.doc file from our main.py, all we need to do is write ./report.doc because we're working within the same directory and we're just getting hold of this file. Now, when you're using relative file path, you can use this ./ but you can also shorten it and get rid of it as well. This is why we've been able to open this my_file.txt which is in the same folder as my main.py and notice how these two files are at the same hierarchical level. So let's do a quick challenge. I'm going to delete the part where we write to the file and I'm going to change my file so it just has one sentence and I'm going to locate this file by using 'Reveal in Finder' and on Windows that would be right- click and Show in Explorer. And it would show you the location of that file in your computer system. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to move this file to the desktop. Right? And what I want you to do is I want you to go to the desktop, right- click on that file. And if you want a Mac, I want you to click on get info. And if you are on a Windows, I want you to right-click and go to properties. Now what you're looking for is this location here. Now you can see that this current file, new_file, is located under the root folder, which in this case is the C:\\Users\\London AppBrewery\\Desktop\\new_file.txt. On a Mac you can see that it's located under the root folder, which is Macintosh HD slash users slash Angela slash desktop slash my_file. txt. Here comes your challenge. Now that we've moved our file away from our project, I want you to fix this code so that when you run it, it won't give you this file not found error because at the moment there is no my_ file.txt in the same working directory as our main.py. It doesn't exist inside this folder. Have a think about what you've learned so far and see if you can change this path so that our code works again. And it's the same on Windows. Use the location of the file on your computer and use the absolute path in the code to get it to work. Pause the video now. Okay All right. Here's how you would use the absolute path. So we know that our, my_file.txt is located in the root folder and then it's users, angela, desktop. So let's go ahead and change this string. Let's start at the root and then let's add the next folder, which is users. And then let's add another slash and then we go to the next folder, which is Angela. Now of course, this will be different for you, but finally we go to our desktop and then we can get to our, my_file.txt. So this is the full path to get to this file. So now if I run this code again, you can see it's able to read the file, there is no errors, and it's getting hold of the contents of the file. Now on Windows, it's a similar story. So we know that the location of the file is root, then users, then LondonAppBrewery, then desktop. Again, this of course will be different for you depending on your username, but you should see it in your location when you take a look at the file properties. So let's change this. Let's start out at the root, which is the C drive, and then let's go to users. And then we go to our username which is LondonAppBrewery , and then we go to our desktop and that is where it should find this new_file. txt. So now when I hit run, you can see that it's able to fetch that file and print the content without any errors. Now, one of the peculiarities about file paths in Windows and Mac is that in a Mac, the path, each of the folders are separated by a / whereas on Windows, they're separated by a \\. But as you've noticed, when we're writing Python code, we don't care about that. We can just write it as / and making sure that we have the root, which represents the C drive, so this entire part, and then we have our folder, the next folder, the next folder, the next folder, et cetera. So now comes the next challenge. You can see that this path follows from the root folder, which is the C drive and on the Mac, it's also from the Macintosh HD. So what if we wanted to change this so that it's relative to our current main .py? Our main.py if we go to 'Show in Explorer', you can see that the path for this file is the following. It's under Users/LondonAppBrewery/PyCharmProjects/WindowsDemo. So that's the name of my project. And then afterwards, it's my main.py. So this is a bit of a tricky question. Given that this file is inside this current folder or whatever it is that you have as your folder which contains this file, how can you get it to use a relative file path so that it jumps back two folders to the LondonAppBrewery folder and then goes to Desktop and then to new file? On our Mac, it's a similar story. So we go to 'Reveal in Finder'. We can see this is where we are currently. So our current working directory is this day-24 project folder. So if we go one level up and the shortcut is command + up, we go to our day-24 folder. So this is our working directory. Now, if we want to go up one level, we can go to go, and then go to including folder, so one level up that gets us to PyCharm projects. And then if we go one level up further, we get to our Angela folder at which point we can then navigate downwards to Desktop/my_file.txt. This is your challenge. Figure out what the relative path to the text file on your desktop should be then modify the code and get it to work. Pause the video now. The way that we would modify this is in order to get to this Angela folder where we can continue to our Desktop and then to my file, we have to go up two levels. So that translates to ../../ and now we're inside the Angela folder. So we can start going down. And PyCharm is smart enough to know what your folder structure looks like. So it will start giving you hints as to what folders are accessible at this level. So I can get to Desktop and then I can get to my_file.txt. And if I go ahead and run my code, you can see it's able to read and print the content of that file. The main difference between an absolute file path and a relative file path is the absolute file path is always relative to the root of your computer. On Windows that's the C drive, usually anyways unless you've changed it. And on a Mac, it is the Macintosh HD. Now the relative file path is relative to your current working directory. So it depends on where you are and where you're trying to get to. Now, depending on the situation and where that file you are interested in is located, you might decide to use the absolute file path or the relative file path. And you can see that in this case it's not necessarily that much shorter or that much more easier to understand. So if you know how to do both, then you can adapt to the situation and figure out which one is most appropriate. Now I know that paths can be confusing. So that's why I've come up with a whole bunch of quiz exercises for you in the next lesson for you to get more the practice with file paths so that you can feel confident leaving this lesson. So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson. All right, guys, it's time to put what you've learned to the test. Now in this project, we're going to be doing a little bit of mail merging. So mail merging is where you take something like what we have a list of names, for example, and we want to insert each of these names into a letter. So instead of saying dear [name], you are invited to my birthday the Saturday, it should say dear and then it would replace that with whatever is here. Take a look at this example file. You can see that it replaced the name placeholder with the first name in the invited_names.txt file. Your objective is to write some python code to automate the process. So what you're going to end up with is a bunch of letters, one for each of the names inside the invited_ names.txt and the letters are going to be named like this:",
      "for name in "

      "while and I lack imagination. Now in order to create this list of long_names, I'm going to use that new keyword pattern that we learned, which is, \"new_item for item in list if test\". The list is again going to be our list of names. Each of the items we can call it anything we want, but I'm going to call it name. And if you find that this is too similar to this, you can call it anything you want, nom, you can use French, you can just write n or you can do anything you want. This name that we're looping through is going to be tested in order to see if we're actually going to create a new_item. The test in this case, is we're checking to see if the length of the name is now greater than 5, and if this name that we're currently looping through passes this test, then we get to specify what the new_item should be. So the new_item is going to be that particular name that passed the test, but then it's going to be uppercased. So we're going to call name.upper() in order to create the new_item that's going to be added to the list. So now once I hit Enter, you can see the new list that I've created. Long names has Caroline, Eleanor, and Freddie all in uppercase. Essentially, we looped through each of the names in the list, we took each of those names and checked that they're longer than 5, if they were in fact longer than 5, then we looked at this part of the code to see what we should do with each of those names, and in our case, we've turned it into uppercase. So there's quite a lot of theory covered in today's lesson. Now, in order to be able to fully understand what's going on, you can't just watch me talk about it, you have to practice. So in the coming lessons, I've got a whole bunch of exercises for you to practice using and creating list comprehensions for yourself. And that way, once you've done the drills, you've done the code press-ups, then you'll be able to show off your list comprehension muscles. For all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson. Now the reason why we're learning about list comprehensions is because when we created all US states game, I realized that the code that we were writing could be a lot shorter if only we knew about list comprehensions. So I want you to head back over to your code for the US states game and open it up. And I want you to look at this if statement. So when the user types exit, we create a new list of missing states in order to save it to a CSV file. I want you to change this code using your new knowledge of this comprehension and see if you can cut down this code by three or four lines. Pause the video and complete this challenge now. All right. So instead of all of this, creating a new empty missing state and then going through a for loop, we can simply do this in one line. So again, it's going to be called missing_states and this is going to be a new list, but this time it's going to be created using our list comprehension; new item for item in list if test. The list in this case that we're looping through is all of our states. So we're gonna replace that with all states. Now, each of the items is basically a state in that list. And the test that we're going to make is to see well if the state is not in the guessed_states which has states added every time the user makes a correct guess so we can basically take this part of our previous code and put it here. And in that case, then we're going to add this particular state which pass this test into this new list. This one line basically will replace all four of these lines and it cuts down dramatically on the amount of code. And it reads relatively well as well. Add a state to this new list if we loop through all the states in the list of states and if that state is not in this list of guessed states. List comprehensions are super popular with Python developers and I hope through some of these exercises you can see why, just in terms of the sheer amount of code that it cuts down on and how much it simplifies things. Now, in addition to list comprehensions, we can also do comprehensions with dictionaries. So in the next lesson, that's what we're going to be looking at. Now that you've seen how list comprehension works, it's time to learn about another type of comprehension, dictionary comprehensions. This is also super useful because it allows us to create a new dictionary from the values in a list or in a dictionary. For example, we could write out our keywords like this. We're going to create a new dictionary called new_dict, and it's going to be created using this curly bracket now instead of square brackets. And inside the comprehension, we get to set the new_key, the new_value, and we get to loop through items in a list. So any sort of iterable; a list, a range, a string, anything you want. And this is the simplest form of dictionary comprehension. Now remember that a dictionary comprehension is just a way of creating a dictionary using this shortened syntax. We could take this one step further. We could also create a new dictionary based on the values in an existing dictionary. So we could take that dictionary and then get hold of all of the items inside that dictionary, and then split it into a key and a value. So now, we're looping through each of the keys and each of the values in all of the items from the dictionary, and we can use these key and value variables to create a new_key or a new_value. And to go one step further for completion sake, we can, of course, as always add our condition at the very end, just like we did before with list comprehensions. So let's see how this code works in practice. I'm going to take my previous list of names and then I'm going to click on this button to refresh my console so that all of the previous variables get deleted. So now I'm going to create a new list of names. So I'm going to use the previous names I had before, and this is our list here. Now, the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a dictionary where I generate a random score for each of these names. So let's imagine we had a bunch of students and we wanted to create some random scores for each of them so that they would get a random score between 1 and 100. Now for the teachers out there, I really hope this is not what you do when you generate the students' scores. But essentially we want to create a dictionary which looks something like this. Each of the students in this list, so let's start out with Alex. We want our dictionary to have a key, which is the name of the student, and then a value, which is their random score. And we want to continue through that list of names until we've generated a random score for each of them. That's the goal. And now we have to use our dictionary comprehension. Remember, when we're creating a new list using lists comprehension, we're using square brackets. But now we're creating a dictionary so we're going to use curly brackets. Now, inside these curly brackets, I'm going to put down my usual list of keywords. So it's going to be a new_key: new_value that we're going to be adding to our new dictionary. And then I'm going to do a for item in list. In this case, our list or our iterable is going to be all lists of names. Now, even though in my keywords I always use lists, it's just easier to imagine. But it's actually, in fact, any sort of iterable like a range or a string or a tuple. Once we've got our list of names, we're going to name each of those names something, and I'm just going to call it student. So we're looping through all the students in our list of names here. And for each of those students, I'm going to create the student as the new key, but the value is going to be a new, random number. So in order to create a random number, I'm going to have to first import the random module. So I've cut out my previous code, imported random, and let's paste that code back in. So now we can replace the value for each of these dictionary entries with random .randint, and we can generate a random number between 1 and 100. So now when I hit enter, you'll see our new students_scores dictionary being created and you can see we've got all of our students in our list of names, Alex, Beth, Caroline, et cetera. And each of them now have a new random score. So it seems like everybody did pretty well other than Eleanor, I guess. Random score generating seems to work. Now, the next step, we're going to take this a little bit further because this was quite simple. We just did what we did before, which is looping through a list. But now I want to loop through a dictionary. Luckily, we've now created this brand, sparkling, new dictionary, our students_scores, and I want to use that dictionary in my next dictionary comprehension. So the next thing I want to do is to be able to create a dictionary called passed_students. And this is going to be a dictionary which looks through the dictionary of student_scores, so imagine you have an entire high school where everybody's scores are logged and you look at everybody who's got a score of 60 or over. And then we're going to say, well, those people have passed and everybody else has failed that year. Essentially we should loop through this entire dictionary of items, figure out which of these have a value that's equal to 60 or over 60, and then we're gonna add those items back into this new dictionary of passed_students. So essentially, we'd probably end up with, um, Beth, with Caroline, with Dave and with Freddy. So it will still look pretty much the same as our students_scores dictionary. So it would have something like Beth and then colon her score, which is 72. But just the fact that she's included in this dictionary, it means that she has passed. And we will end up with this new dictionary where everybody is a passed student and bear scores. Have a think about how you might do this. And if you're up for the challenge, try pausing the video and seeing if you can complete this. As always, we know that we're going to create a new dictionary, so curly braces, and then it's going to be our new_key:",
      "if you're working with a Python dictionary. So I'm going to go ahead and import pandas and I'm going to use pandas to create a new data frame, and it's going to be created from our student dictionary. So you've seen all of this before, and I'll just call this the student_data_frame and I can print it for you to see what it looks like. Okay. This is our data frame. It looks like a pretty standard table with the first column being all of the indices. So at zero index is this first row, and that basically denotes the index of each row. Now working with this data frame, we can actually loop through a data frame using the same method as before. So we can say for key, value in our student_data_frame .items. So if I print each of the keys, you can see it's just going to give me the titles of each column. But if I print each of the values, then it's going to give me the data in each of the columns. Now this is not particularly useful because it's basically just looping through the names of our columns and then the data inside each column. This is why pandas has a inbuilt  loop and it's a method called iterrows. And it allows us to loop through each of the rows of the data frame rather than each of the columns. And the way that we do that is we again use a for loop and then we can get hold of each of the index inside each row, so that corresponds to the number in that first column. And then we can get hold of the data in the row. And then we can say for index row in data frame, which is student_data_frame, and then its that method.iter rows. And now I can loop through each of those rows and print out either the index for each of those rows. So you can see that this is going to print out our data frame here, And then in order to print out each of the index at 0, 1, 2. But I can also print out each of the rows. So now I get the first row has a student and a score, the second row has a student and a score, and the third row has a student and score. So each of these rows is a pandas series object. So that means we can tap into the row and then get hold of the value under a particular column by using the dot notation. So we can say row.student and now when it goes through the loop, you can see first, it's going to print out our entire data frame, and then it's going to print out each of the students inside that data frame. Now I can also say row.score, and now it's going to give me each of the scores inside the data frame. And I can even do something like this where I say if the row.student is equal to Angela, well then we can print that particular row that we're currently looping on, .score. And this way we would get the student, Angela's score which happens to be 56, as you can verify here. Now we're finally ready to tackle our project, and this project is based on a real-life struggle that I have. Often when I'm calling a company and over the phone I have to give some sort of details right? They'll ask me, what is your name, and can you spell it? So I'll have to be like A-N-G-E-L-A. And they're like, wait, was that an E? Was that a B, what did you say? In these cases often I have to sort of default to some sort of Naval alphabet. where I say A is the alfa, N for November, G for golf. And then at some point I forget what E stands for and I'm like E for.. elephant? And there have been times where I've just completely taken the MIG and said things like M for mnemonic, P for pneumonia, W for wrench, which doesn't make any sense at all because these are silent letters. And I've had some very angry people, um, but it was quite fun. So now what we want to create is we want to create a tool that takes the NATO phonetic alphabet which was generated because it's often really, really important for the other side to know exactly what it is that you said and which letters you're spelling out so that they don't mistaken your E for a B or your T for a C cause it all sounds really similar. Head over to the course resources page where you can find the starting files for the NATO alphabet project. I want you to practice with list comprehension and with dictionary comprehension. But in this case, we're not going through a dictionary per se, but we're actually going through a data frame because our data lives inside a CSV. So we're going to be reading it using pandas. and then we're going to end up with a data frame. Instead of having a bog standard dictionary comprehension where our keywords were new_key: new_value for key, value in dict.items. Now we're going to change this for-loop so instead of using the simple for loop where we're just looping through a dictionary, we're going to use this particular loop. So then in this case, we're saying for index row in our data frame, and then it's .iterrows as the method. So basically I want you to use this different loop in order to loop through our data frame and then create a new dictionary using a new key and new value. So what exactly is it that I want you to do with this? Well, I want you to be able to take the CSV of NATO phonetic alphabet, and I want you to do two things to it. The first thing is for you to create a dictionary in this format. The format is basically the key is going to be the actual letter, so maybe A. And then the value is going to be the corresponding code for the NATO phonetic alphabet. So A actually is for alpha. And then the next one is B, which stands for Bravo. Essentially, we're going to take the CSV and we're going to convert it into a dictionary in this particular format where the keys are the letters inside the CSV, so that first column, and then the values are the corresponding code words for each of those letters. And the reason why we're talking about iterrows and had to loop through rows of a data frame instead of just getting you to get hold of the data frame and then just say to_dict like what we did before, is because it's not going to give it to you in this particular format. So you're going to have to use what you've learned about dictionary comprehension in order to create a dictionary in this particular format. And then once you've created a dictionary in this format, then the next step is a lot easier. You are going to create a list of the phonetic code words from a word that the user inputs. That way the user can use the input to type a word. So for example, Thomas, and then when they hit enter, they get a list printed out that is the phonetic alphabet code word for each of the letters in their input. So Tango, Hotel, Oscar Mike, Alpha Sierra, which they can then read back using our little tool. I would say that to do step 1 is a lot harder than to do step 2. But essentially, to do step 1 is a dictionary comprehension, creating a dictionary in this format from the CSV, and to do number 2 is basically completing the project and being able to create and print out a list of the code words based on the word that the user inputs. So I want you to pause the video, have a think about how you might solve this, and then go ahead to the course resources and download this starting zip file so that you can open it up inside PyCharm and create your project. Pause the video and give that a go now. Once you've unzipped and opened up the starting file inside PyCharm, this is what you'd see. There is a CSV file that contains each of the letters and the code word, and there's also our main.py with some of the example code that I showed you in the last lesson. Now, if you don't know how to complete this challenge, especially step 1, I really urge you to go through this example code and just go through each of the different types of loops and see what it is that you get when you print the key or the value. And in this case, when you print the index or when you print the row. And then see what happens when you get hold of some of the items in the row. And seeing how maybe the row.student or the row. score works. Once you fully understood this, then it should be relatively easy to complete step 1. So essentially the goal is that we want to create a dictionary that looks like this from the CSV. The first thing we have to do is to go ahead and import pandas. And if you need to install it, there should be a squiggly line and then you can click on it and the light bulb will help you install the pandas module. But once we've gotten hold of the pandas, we can go ahead and use it to read CSV from our file which is this file. It's under the file path of just nato_phonetic_ alphabet.csv. So it will save this as our data which is basically going to be our data frame. Now, once we've got hold of our data, then you can see that if we print this out, it looks like this. But if we use that method, to_dict, and then we try to print it out, you can see that it's not organized the dictionary in the format that we want it to, which is to have the letter as the key, the corresponding code as the value. In order to complete step 1 as I mentioned, we're going to have to use dictionary comprehension. And the method is going to be using the iterrows to iterate through each of the rows inside that data frame. So I'm going to copy that line here, and I'm going to paste it in here. Now, this is the format, so let's go ahead and replace each of the keywords. Our data frame, in our case, is just called data. And then we're going to say data iterate through each of the rows, and then for each of the index and the row, we're going to do something with it. Now the new key is going to be the row.letter and the new value is going to come from that row as well and it's going to be row.code. So this is the code that will create our new dictionary and I'm going to call this our phonetic_dictionary. Now, if I print that out, you can see that this is the straight up data.to_dict and then the second line is the one where we've actually formatted it using what we've learned about dictionary comprehension. Once we've gotten hold of this phonetic dictionary, then to do step 2 is incredibly easy because all we have to do is to create some sort of inputs, ask the user to enter a word, and then we can save this input to a variable. Now, once they've entered the word, we have to check it against each of the keys inside this phonetic dictionary. So notice how each of the keys all uppercased. So we're going to have to change whatever it is that the user has inputted all to upper. So that way, if they entered a lowercase or an uppercase, it doesn't really matter because we're going to convert the whole string to uppercase. And then we're going to use our list comprehension. The way we create our list comprehension is going to be new item for item in list. So in this case, our list or the thing that we're going to iterate through is going to be our word. And then we're going to go through each of the letters in the word. And once we have each of the letters, we're going to go through our phonetic dictionary, this one right here, and pick out the value that corresponds to the particular letter that we're iterating on. So we're going to use the square brackets and then pass in the letter like this. Now we've created our output list and we can go ahead and print it out. Now let's go ahead and comment out this line and run our code. So it's going to ask me to enter a word, I'm going to enter my name. And now it's managed to convert that into a list of phonetic alphabets that corresponds to each of the letters in that word. Did you manage to complete this challenge? And if not, which part did you stumble on? Was it the part where you were using the iterrows? If so, then go back to the starting file for this project and go through each of the different ways that we're looping through it and use print statements to really understand how the loop is actually going through and looking through the data. Now, if on the other hand, it was the dictionary comprehension or the list comprehension, then be sure to go back to the relevant lesson and just make sure that you review it and you write out the code in the lesson for yourself just to be sure that you understand what's going on before you continue to the next day. The big topic that we're going to explore today is a concept known as a List Comprehension. And as I mentioned before, this is something that's really unique to the Python language. In many other programming languages, you don't actually have access to something like this. There's nothing that really compares to it. And it's something that Python developers really, really love because it cuts down on the amount of typing, and it just makes the code a lot shorter and in most cases a lot easier to read. So what exactly is a List Comprehension? Well, it's a case where you create a new list from a previous list. So far we've been doing that using for loops. So for example, if I have a list of numbers [1, 2, 3] and I want to create a new list where each number is increased by one, well then I would use a for loop, creating a new empty list and then looping through each of the numbers in that list in order to add one to each of those numbers. And then I would append each of those increased numbers to my new_list, and I would end up with a new_list that consists of three items. And it will be [2, 3, 4]. Now using list comprehension we can take these four lines of code and turn it into one. And the way that we create a list comprehension looks something like this. I like to use the keyword 'method', where you type out the list comprehension keywords, and then replace each of the words with the actual item in your code. The way that we would create any list comprehension is we would create the name of the new_list, and instead of creating an empty list and then having to append to it or populate it, we're actually going to create it straight in the same line. So we open up a set of square brackets to denote that we're creating a new list, and then we have this, \"new_item for item in list\" keyword pattern. Here's how it would work. Let's take that same thing that we did before, where we took a list of numbers, and we created a new list where each number is increased by one. And let's see how we would do it using list comprehension. So the first keyword I'm going to replace is the list. So this is the list that we're going to iterate through, and in our case it's this list of numbers. So let's replace that list keyword with the actual list, which is numbers. The next thing that is easy to understand is each item in the list. So we can call this anything we want, in the for loop here we called it n, so why don't we go ahead and call it n again. This n is going to represent each of the numbers in that list of numbers, just as it does in this for loop and the final keyword that we haven't yet replaced is the new_item. So what do we want each of the new items to be in this new list? Well, each of the new items is basically calculated by taking n and then adding 1 to it. So this line is the expression or the code that we need to execute in order to get a new_item. So this becomes our final list comprehension. We have our list of numbers, and then we create a new_list where we loop through each of the numbers n inside this list of numbers, and then for each of the n, we add one to it in order to create the final list. So when you look at a list comprehension just like this, as in the real code, it can be a little bit confusing to see. How would you read it? Which order does it happen? But when you're using this keyword method that I often use, where you just type out what you need to have inside a list comprehension, you need a name for the new list. You need a set of square brackets. And then inside the square brackets, you have, \"new_item for item in list,\" and then you go through it replacing each of the keywords list, item and new_item. So I want you to have a go at actually writing out this code. Go ahead and create a new PyCharm project. And I want you to go into the Python console. We're not actually going to be writing code inside our main.py, and the reason is because the console allows us to write code line by line, and then we can view our variables really easily on the right hand side pane here. For example, if I have my list of numbers [1, 2, 3] and then I have to write out my list comprehension where we create our new_list, which I'll call new_numbers. And then we have to create our list comprehension. So the way to remember it is, \"new_item for item in list.\" So now go ahead and write this out and see if you can remember how we actually structure our list comprehension, and see if you can get it to work within your PyCharm console. So pause the video. Give that a go. All right. So our list is of course this list of numbers. So let's replace that first. And then for each of the items in that list of numbers, well we can call it anything we want. So I'm just going to call it n or num, it doesn't matter. But as long as you're consistent in using it when you create the new_item, because each new_item is going to be the n, which is each number in the list + 1. So now when I hit Enter, you can see I've got this new list called new_numbers created from the previous list numbers, and this now has the same number of items, but each item is now increased by one. Now it's important to remember that when we say list comprehension, it doesn't strictly mean that you can only work with lists, you can work with other sequences like strings, for example. So here I've got a variable called name which is just a string. It's the word, Angela. And I'm creating a new_list by using a list comprehension that has this kind of code. Now, I want you to pause for a second and think about what would be in this new_list. What would it look like? And then I want you to try it out inside PyCharm. So pause the video now. All right. So, name = \"Angela\". This is the variable that we're working with, and then I'm going to create a new_list which I'll call letters_list. This new list is going to be created using my list comprehension. So it's going to be, \"letter for letter in name.\" And what this does is it takes this sequence, this string, it goes through each of the letters in that string, and then it adds each of the letters into this new_list. So when I hit Enter, you can see this is what letters_list looks like. It's just split off my string into individual letters, and it's added it into a brand new list. As I mentioned, these things in Python, like a list, or a string, or a range, or tuple, they're called sequences because they have a specific order, and when you perform a list comprehension, it's going to take that sequence and it's going to go through it in order, either be it the letters in the string, or the items in a list, and then it's going to take each of those items in that correct order and then do something with it. Either add 1 to it or in this case, do nothing and just add it to a new list. Here's a challenge for you. Can you take the range, which is also a sequence that we can iterate through, and then create a range between 1 and 5? And remember that the way that the range works is it's going to take 1, and then 2 and then 3 and then 4, but it's not going to go up to 5. I want you to loop through this range and then create a list where each of the numbers in the range is doubled, and the final list should look like this, it'll be [2, 4, 6, 8]. Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge. All right. So let's create our new list which I'm just going to call range_list, and we're going to use that keyword pattern to remind ourselves. So it's going to be, \"new_item for item in list.\" And this list in this case, is actually not going to be a list, it's going to be a range between 1 and 5. And then each of the items we get to give it a name, which I'll just call num. And then in this new list, what is each new_item going to be? Well, it's going to be num * two. So now when I hit Enter, I get my range list, which is [2, 4, 6, 8]. So it's looped through each of the numbers in the range, and it's multiplied each of those numbers by 2, and then it's created a new list using each of those numbers. Now the final thing I want to show you regarding list comprehensions is that there's also such a thing as a Conditional List Comprehension. This takes our keywords a little bit further, whereas previously we stopped right here, \"new_item for item in list,\" we can also tag on two more keywords 'if' and a 'test'. What this is going to allow us to do is to only add this new item, and only to perform this code if the test actually passes. Here's an example. I've got a bunch of names here [\"Alex\", \"Beth\", \"Caroline\", \"Dave\", \"Elanor\", \"Freddie\"]. Now, one of the neat things that you can actually do with the Python console is not only can you view what all of the variables are equal to, but you can also edit them if you have an issue. The sharp-eyed amongst you will know that I've actually made a typo in this name. It's not Elanor, it's actually spelled a little bit differently. So what I can do on the right-hand pane here is I can right-click on that piece of data that I want to change, and then click Set Value, and then actually change the data here. Now that I've got that spelled out correctly, if I type names and hit Enter, you can see it's now been corrected. And this is my new list of names. So using this list of names, I'm going to try and create a new list of names, but I only want the short names. I only want the names which is made up of four letters or less, like Alex or Beth. The way I would do this is I would create a new list, which is called short_names, and then I would use my list comprehension. And remember in this case the keywords are, \"new_item for item in list and then if and a test\". So let's fill in the easy parts first. The list is going to be our list of names. The item I can call it anything I want, I'll just call it name in terms of the singular form of names. And then once I loop through each of the names inside my list of names, what is the new item going to be? Well, it's actually going to be unmodified, it's just going to be that same name, but in this case I'm only going to add that name to the list if it passes this test. And this test is going to look at the length of the name which I created here, so if I named this n, then I would be testing it against n and I would be adding n as well, but because I've called it name, so I'm going to use that name right here in the condition. So if the length of the name is less than 5, so it has 4 or less characters, then I'm going to add that name to my new_list. Now when I hit Enter you can see that I've got this new list of short_names and it only contains the names, Alex, Beth, and Dave. So this list comprehension is now a little bit more complex because the first thing it does is it goes through each of the names inside this list of names, it checks each of those names for its length, and if the length is 5, then it adds the name to this new list. Now here's a challenge for you. I want you to take all of the names from this list of names, which are made up of 5 letters or more, so basically, Caroline, Eleanor and Freddy, and I want you to turn each of these names to the uppercase version. What you should end up with is a list where you have Caroline in all caps, Eleanor in all caps, and Freddie in all caps. But of course, you're not going to just type this out, you're going to use list comprehension. Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge. All right I'm going to call this new list long_names because I haven't eaten for a while and I lack imagination. Now in order to create this list of long_names, I'm going to use that new keyword pattern that we learned, which is, \"new_item for item in list if test\". The list is again going to be our list of names. Each of the items we can call it anything we want, but I'm going to call it name. And if you find that this is too similar to this, you can call it anything you want, nom, you can use French, you can just write n or you can do anything you want. This name that we're looping through is going to be tested in order to see if we're actually going to create a new_item. The test in this case, is we're checking to see if the length of the name is now greater than 5, and if this name that we're currently looping through passes this test, then we get to specify what the new_item should be. So the new_item is going to be that particular name that passed the test, but then it's going to be uppercased. So we're going to call name.upper() in order to create the new_item that's going to be added to the list. So now once I hit Enter, you can see the new list that I've created. Long names has Caroline, Eleanor, and Freddie all in uppercase. Essentially, we looped through each of the names in the list, we took each of those names and checked that they're longer than 5, if they were in fact longer than 5, then we looked at this part of the code to see what we should do with each of those names, and in our case, we've turned it into uppercase. So there's quite a lot of theory covered in today's lesson. Now, in order to be able to fully understand what's going on, you can't just watch me talk about it, you have to practice. So in the coming lessons, I've got a whole bunch of exercises for you to practice using and creating list comprehensions for yourself. And that way, once you've done the drills, you've done the code press-ups, then you'll be able to show off your list comprehension muscles. For all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson. Now the reason why we're learning about list comprehensions is because when we created all US states game, I realized that the code that we were writing could be a lot shorter if only we knew about list comprehensions. So I want you to head back over to your code for the US states game and open it up. And I want you to look at this if statement. So when the user types exit, we create a new list of missing states in order to save it to a CSV file. I want you to change this code using your new knowledge of this comprehension and see if you can cut down this code by three or four lines. Pause the video and complete this challenge now. All right. So instead of all of this, creating a new empty missing state and then going through a for loop, we can simply do this in one line. So again, it's going to be called missing_states and this is going to be a new list, but this time it's going to be created using our list comprehension; new item for item in list if test. The list in this case that we're looping through is all of our states. So we're gonna replace that with all states. Now, each of the items is basically a state in that list. And the test that we're going to make is to see well if the state is not in the guessed_states which has states added every time the user makes a correct guess so we can basically take this part of our previous code and put it here. And in that case, then we're going to add this particular state which pass this test into this new list. This one line basically will replace all four of these lines and it cuts down dramatically on the amount of code. And it reads relatively well as well. Add a state to this new list if we loop through all the states in the list of states and if that state is not in this list of guessed states. List comprehensions are super popular with Python developers and I hope through some of these exercises you can see why, just in terms of the sheer amount of code that it cuts down on and how much it simplifies things. Now, in addition to list comprehensions, we can also do comprehensions with dictionaries. So in the next lesson, that's what we're going to be looking at. Now that you've seen how list comprehension works, it's time to learn about another type of comprehension, dictionary comprehensions. This is also super useful because it allows us to create a new dictionary from the values in a list or in a dictionary. For example, we could write out our keywords like this. We're going to create a new dictionary called new_dict, and it's going to be created using this curly bracket now instead of square brackets. And inside the comprehension, we get to set the new_key, the new_value, and we get to loop through items in a list. So any sort of iterable; a list, a range, a string, anything you want. And this is the simplest form of dictionary comprehension. Now remember that a dictionary comprehension is just a way of creating a dictionary using this shortened syntax. We could take this one step further. We could also create a new dictionary based on the values in an existing dictionary. So we could take that dictionary and then get hold of all of the items inside that dictionary, and then split it into a key and a value. So now, we're looping through each of the keys and each of the values in all of the items from the dictionary, and we can use these key and value variables to create a new_key or a new_value. And to go one step further for completion sake, we can, of course, as always add our condition at the very end, just like we did before with list comprehensions. So let's see how this code works in practice. I'm going to take my previous list of names and then I'm going to click on this button to refresh my console so that all of the previous variables get deleted. So now I'm going to create a new list of names. So I'm going to use the previous names I had before, and this is our list here. Now, the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a dictionary where I generate a random score for each of these names. So let's imagine we had a bunch of students and we wanted to create some random scores for each of them so that they would get a random score between 1 and 100. Now for the teachers out there, I really hope this is not what you do when you generate the students' scores. But essentially we want to create a dictionary which looks something like this. Each of the students in this list, so let's start out with Alex. We want our dictionary to have a key, which is the name of the student, and then a value, which is their random score. And we want to continue through that list of names until we've generated a random score for each of them. That's the goal. And now we have to use our dictionary comprehension. Remember, when we're creating a new list using lists comprehension, we're using square brackets. But now we're creating a dictionary so we're going to use curly brackets. Now, inside these curly brackets, I'm going to put down my usual list of keywords. So it's going to be a new_key: new_value that we're going to be adding to our new dictionary. And then I'm going to do a for item in list. In this case, our list or our iterable is going to be all lists of names. Now, even though in my keywords I always use lists, it's just easier to imagine. But it's actually, in fact, any sort of iterable like a range or a string or a tuple. Once we've got our list of names, we're going to name each of those names something, and I'm just going to call it student. So we're looping through all the students in our list of names here. And for each of those students, I'm going to create the student as the new key, but the value is going to be a new, random number. So in order to create a random number, I'm going to have to first import the random module. So I've cut out my previous code, imported random, and let's paste that code back in. So now we can replace the value for each of these dictionary entries with random .randint, and we can generate a random number between 1 and 100. So now when I hit enter, you'll see our new students_scores dictionary being created and you can see we've got all of our students in our list of names, Alex, Beth, Caroline, et cetera. And each of them now have a new random score. So it seems like everybody did pretty well other than Eleanor, I guess. Random score generating seems to work. Now, the next step, we're going to take this a little bit further because this was quite simple. We just did what we did before, which is looping through a list. But now I want to loop through a dictionary. Luckily, we've now created this brand, sparkling, new dictionary, our students_scores, and I want to use that dictionary in my next dictionary comprehension. So the next thing I want to do is to be able to create a dictionary called passed_students. And this is going to be a dictionary which looks through the dictionary of student_scores, so imagine you have an entire high school where everybody's scores are logged and you look at everybody who's got a score of 60 or over. And then we're going to say, well, those people have passed and everybody else has failed that year. Essentially we should loop through this entire dictionary of items, figure out which of these have a value that's equal to 60 or over 60, and then we're gonna add those items back into this new dictionary of passed_students. So essentially, we'd probably end up with, um, Beth, with Caroline, with Dave and with Freddy. So it will still look pretty much the same as our students_scores dictionary. So it would have something like Beth and then colon her score, which is 72. But just the fact that she's included in this dictionary, it means that she has passed. And we will end up with this new dictionary where everybody is a passed student and bear scores. Have a think about how you might do this. And if you're up for the challenge, try pausing the video and seeing if you can complete this. As always, we know that we're going to create a new dictionary, so curly braces, and then it's going to be our new_key:",

      "while like writing your next book or coding up a project. And then you want to set your timer to the 25 minutes and then work on the task for 25 minutes. And then after that, you take a short five-minute break. And after you've done four of these Pomodoros, basically four repetition, then you get to take a 15 to 30 minute break. So this basically really effectively utilizes the way that our brain works to take short breaks often and to work for 25 minutes at a time, which helps us with information retention and also keeping up the motivation. This is the program that we're going to be building using tkinter. It's going to be a timer with a tomato on it. And when you click start, it's going to tell you to work for 25 minutes. Then that window can go into the background and while you're writing your code or doing whatever, when the timer's up, it will pop to the very front of the screen above all of the other windows and tell you to take a break. So the first break is for five minutes and you'll notice here, we've already achieved one check mark for our first Pomodoro completed. And once you're done with the break, then it's going to go back to work and it's going to continue until you reach the longer break or until you click reset to stop and reset the timer. Effectively, it's going to help you do these Pomodoros where you have 25-minute work, 5-minute break. You do four of these 25-minute work sessions, and then you get a 20-minute break. So hopefully by creating this program, you're going to increase your productivity and you're going to have your own handy tool to help you achieve more and do more. So this is what we're going to be building. Once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and let's get started. The first thing I want you to do to get started is to head over to the course resources and download the starting files for the Pomodoro project. Once you've got that, then you should be able to unzip this file and get hold of the starting folder. Next, I want you to open up that folder using PyCharm. So in my case, my folder's inside my downloads, and then I'll just click open. And PyCharm should automatically configure the latest version of Python you've got installed. So if you take a look inside this folder, there's two files. There is a image of a tomato which we're going to use in our project, and there's also a main.py with a couple of sections already hashed out for you. And we've also included some constants, like some color hex codes or a font name or the number of minutes for working short breaks in a long breaks. So that's already in the starting file. The first thing we're going to do is to set up our UI. So under the section UI set up, we're going to create a new window using tkinter and we're going to get the window to run and give it a background color, pretty simple. So let's go to the top of our file and import our tkinter module. And then if we scroll down to our UI setup section, let's go ahead and create a new window from the tk class. Remember that our tk class is one of the classes from tkinter so you can either tap into the tkinter module and then get hold of the tk class like I have done here, or as in our case, if we're going to be using a lot of classes from tkinter then we can simply say from tkinter let's go ahead and import all of the classes. So that way we can straight away refer to this tk class. Now that we've created our window, the next thing we can do is to set the title of the window, which you can of course call it anything you want. But in my case, I'm going to set it to just Pomodoro, which just means tomato in Italian. So now that we've got our Pomodoro, then we're going to get our window to show up by using window.main loop as usual. And now if we run this, code our main, and you can see we've got a blank window, a title, and we're ready to go to the next step. The next step is to put an image into our program so that we can have this tomato as the background of our program, and then we can put some text on top which is going to signify our countdown timer. This is what we're aiming for, but to achieve this and to be able to put images onto the screen which look like this, we're going to have to learn about the tkinter canvas widget. A canvas widget is a little bit like a real life canvas, really. It allows you to layer things one on top of the others. So you could draw something and then you can draw something on top of that. And what it allows us to do in our case is to place an image onto our program and then to place some text straight on top of that. In between our window creation and the window main loop is where we're going to create our canvas. And our canvas is created using the canvas widget of course. One of the things that we can specify when we create our canvas is a width and a height, and that will be a value in terms of pixels. So we know that we want to display this tomato image inside that canvas. And we can see that this has a, roughly a width of 200 and a height of 223. So let's create a canvas that's roughly about the same size as the image. So we'll put a width of 200 and a height of 224 so that we work with some even numbers. Once I've created my canvas the next thing I want to do is to add my image to it. And we can use a method that the canvas has it which is called create_image. And as soon as I type create, you can see there's actually a whole bunch of other methods like create the text in the canvas, create a rectangle, create an oval. And all of these things could be overlapped on each other inside the same canvas. Now, when we create an image, there's a couple of things which are required. The first thing is the X and Y positions of this image in the canvas. Given that we have a width of 200 and a height of 224, I want my image to be bang in the center of the canvas. So I can provide the X value as half of the width and the Y value as half of the height. In addition to the X and Y values, we also have to specify a image. But I can't just simply just type the name of my image which is tomato.png, because that is not the type of data that this argument is expecting. What it wants instead is something called a photo image and this class comes from tkinter and it's basically a way to read through a file and to get hold of a particular image at a particular file location. In my case, the file location is in fact tomato.png. And if your image was stored in say another sub folder or a different place, then you should provide the relative or absolute file path to get there from where your code is, which is the main.py. But in our case it's very easy, they're both in the same folder, so we can simply specify our filename like so. The next thing we're going to do is we're going to save this photo image in a variable so we can refer to it later on. I'm going to call this our tomato_img. Feel free to call it anything you want. And that is the data that goes into this image argument. Now we've created our canvas, we've created our photo image, we've told our canvas to create an image at this position, and then we've put the image inside. The final thing we need to do is to pack our canvas or use some other sort of method to specify the layout of how the canvas is going to go on the screen. And now we can hit run, and we can see our image on the screen. So now notice how the image is basically taking up the entire space of the window. And in fact, the window is resizing itself to fit this image. Wouldn't it be better if this screen was actually a little bit bigger? So we don't just look at the image of a tomato. We can do that by getting our window to be configured. And the configuration that we want to change is the padding, so I'm going to change the padx and pady. On the X-axis on the horizontal I'm actually going to add a whole hundred pixels of padding on both sides. And then on the Yaxis, pady, I'm going to change that to 50 so that it's got 50 pixels of padding on the top. That's looking pretty good other than one small defect. You can see that our tomato image is a little bit cut off on the left and I suspect this is because the actual image is a little bit shifted over to the left. So we can actually adjust this X position to be a little bit more to the right, and that way our tomato can be centered on screen without being cut off on either side. So now that we've tweaked our image and we've displayed it on the screen, the next thing to do is to display some text. As you noticed before, in addition to canvas.create_image, they will a whole bunch of other things we could create, including some texts. This create_text method works very similarly to the create_image method. Notice how the first thing that's getting highlighted is the *args. And then we've got our **kw. So remember from the lessons yesterday, these arguments are the unlimited positional arguments and these arguments are the unlimited keyword arguments. So the keyword arguments here are for example the image or the background color or anything else, but these are the X and Y values. So creating the text, we also have to provide a X and Y value. So I'm just going to try the same values as the image to see how that looks. And now we can add some keyword arguments, for example, the text. So I just want it to say 00:00, which looks pretty much like the clock. Now, if we run our code, you can see we've got a little bit of text showing up. Now, notice how it's a little bit high up on the tomato, because remember the tomato starts at the top here and ends here. So that is the center of the tomato image, but we can move it down a little bit so that it's actually centered in this red part, the circular part. With a little bit of experimentation, I think this, 103, 130, actually works quite well and it's pretty much bang in the center of the tomato. Let's modify this text in some other ways. We can change the fill which is basically the color of the text and I'm going to change that to white, that you can see here. And then I'm going to change the font as well. And this is going to expect a tuple. So it's going to be the font name and then the size, and then whether, if it's bold or italic or whatever else you want to do. Now in the constants here, I've already got the font name defined, which is gonna be Courier that we're gonna be using. So that we can straight up add our font name and then we'll add a font size as 35, and it will say, yeah, make it bold. So there you have it. We've got our tomato, we've got our text showing up as the countdown timer. Now, the final thing I want to do is just to change the background color to a slightly nicer looking color. Now, one of my favorite websites is this one called colorhunt.io, which shows you a whole bunch of different color palettes that professional designers have a created and it makes it really easy for us to just snap up some of these hex codes and use them straight away in our program. Now, the one that really caught my eye is this one, cause it has a bit of the tomato color palette. So I've transferred all of these hex codes to the constants in the starting file. So you can see I've got the pink, the red, the green, the yellow, and we're going to be using that across our program to give it that consistent color theme and make it look like it's been professionally designed. So what I want to do is I want to change the window's background color, and I can do that through the keyword argument called at bg for background, and I can set it to a hex code. So a hex code starts out with the pound sign and then it's some numbers and some letters. Now I've already got all of that for you and all you have to do is just to put down the name of the constant. So this should not be in quotation marks because it's not the word. It is in fact, referring to that particular variable and the string that's held inside. So now if we check our screen, you can see the background has been changed to that nice yellow color, sort of rice or hay color, but the tomato, namely the canvas, still has that white background. So let's change the background color of the canvas as well. And again, it's using the bg. So some of these, you'll notice, are standard attributes that we can change like the width and the height and the background color, which is standard across all of the widgets. And some other things like file here are some of the more specific keyword arguments. So let's apply this yellow to the background of the canvas, and you can see that the canvas is now yellow as well. But it's still got this little white border which denotes the edges of our canvas. To get rid of that I found a specific keyword argument that would actually help and it took quite a bit of digging around, quite a bit of Stack Overflow searching and googling in order to find this. It wasn't very straightforward because tkinter is not well-documented unfortunately. But thankfully for you, all you have to do is find your canvas and on the line where you've created it, go ahead and add this keyword argument. It's called a highlightthickness, and be sure that you spell it right, because it's really long. And remember that there's two Ts cause it's highlight and thickness and there's nothing in between, no underscore, no nothing to separate it. I think that the tkinter team could have really done a little bit better here, but hey. If we set the highlightthickness to zero and we rerun our code, then you should see that it now looks pretty good. And our canvas is now completely the same color as the background of the window. And you can't tell it where the window begins and the canvas ends. Now, the only problem is once we've removed that border around the canvas, our tomato is once again, shifted a little bit. So we can actually adjust this and we can change this back to 100 and I'm going to change it both for the text and the image. And we can make that tomato image perfectly round once more. With tkinter I've found that you have to do quite a bit of tweaking around especially with these positions. And you'll spend some time judging it by eye in terms of the size and the width and where to place it. But we have now successfully managed to place an image onto the screen, changed the background of the window, keep it consistent and add a little bit of text onto our tomato. So now we're ready for the next step. In the next lesson, we're going to create the rest of the user interface. And that is mostly going to be up to you. So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson. In the last lesson, we started setting up our user interface and we created this canvas, placed our image onto it, and also on top of that, put some text. This is how far we've gotten, and we want to now complete setting up the user interface, so adding in some more components. And we wanted to end up looking a bit like this with a label at the top, a big bit of text, some buttons at the bottom, and also a label that keeps track of how many Pomodoros we've done. So each 25 minute work session gets us a check mark. So you are going to be using a lot of the stuff that you learned in yesterday's lessons in terms of which tkinter widgets to use and how to set them up in order to create this. So it's going to be a challenge for you, but before we get started, there's just a couple of things I want to point out. So, one thing to note is that we've got this bg which stands for background color, and we've used our constants up here to set those background colors. Now you can see that here I've got the label and also the check mark in a green color. And that color comes from our constant right here. So you'll be able to color a piece of text in a label, not by using bg, but by using fg which stands for a foreground. And that you can basically set to equal the green color that we've got. And as long as that's added to the label, then you should be able to see that show up. Now, the other thing I want to show you is if you don't know how to get hold of a check mark, the easiest way is just to go onto Wikipedia and find the particular checkmark that you like. And then just copy it and paste it into here as the text. So for example, if we had a label which had a text argument, and I copy that a checkmark and I paste it here, then that checkmark is what's going to show up on screen. Now, the final thing I want to mention before I let you get on with the challenge is that we've packed our canvas onto the screen. But as we've got quite a few things that we need to lay out on the screen, it's much easier to do this using the grid. So I want you to change the canvas to using the grid system. And here I've created a more or less sort of breakdown of how that grid might look like. So you probably will end up with one, two, three, four rows and three columns, and have a think about how you might lay out the labels and the buttons and the check marks relative to those rows and columns. Keeping this page on screen, I want you to pause the video and give this challenge it go. And if you don't know the sizes for things or the fonts, don't worry, just guess them. It doesn't really matter. As long as you've got the rough layout and the correct widgets, then that would be considered a win. Pause the video now and give it a go. All right. So I'm going to get started by creating this top label here and that I'm going to call the title_label and that's going to be created from the label class. Now, the text in this is just going to read timer for now, and I want to change its color by using the foreground keyword argument. And I'm going to change it to that green color that we've got up here. Now, I want to be able to show that label on screen, so I have to give it some form of layout. And as we mentioned, we're going to use the grid system. So I'm going to change the grid. And if we refer to this image, you can see there's going to be three columns. This is going to be in the middle column, and then it's going to be on the first row. So that we're going to start from zero. So I'm going to say column = 1 and row = 0. Now I have to change this canvas pack because otherwise it's going to give me an error. And in terms of where the canvas is, it's going to be again in the same column as that label, but it's going to be on the next row. So column 1, row 1. And now when I run it, you can see our label shows up and then our canvas shows up and it's all correctly positioned. Now I want to change this label so that it looks a little bit more like the demo that I showed you, like this. So I have to change the font and the text to make it a lot bigger. As we've seen before, we can simply add the font when we create the label. So we can set that to a tuple. And first I'm going to use my font name that I've got as a constant which I've used when I created the text, it's just going to be Courier. And then in terms of the size, you can simply just make a guess. It's going to be something pretty large. So I'm going to go with 50 and I'm not going to have it bold or italic or anything, so that's the end of that font. And now when I run it again, you can see its a lot bigger and it looks a lot more like the example that we had here. But the only difference is that it actually still has a white background. Instead of just changing the foreground, I'm also going to change the background and I'm going to make it the same yellow color that I have in the background of the window. So now it looks like it's all blended in and it's all a part of the same application. Let's move on to the next row, which is going to be our buttons. So I'm going to have a start button and I'm also going to have a reset button and they're both going to be created from the button class. The start button is just going to have the text start and the reset button is going to have the word reset. The start button is also going to be laid out on our grid and it's going to be column 0 row 2. And the reset button is going to be column 2, row 2. So now you can see the start and the reset buttons are now on the next row after the canvas and it's either side of it. Now notice how there's a little bit of a white background around each of the buttons. If that bothers you, then you can actually fix that by doing the same thing that we did with the canvas which got rid of the border by changing that highlightthickness to zero. And because that's really prone to typos, I'm actually just going to paste it in. So now you can see that whiteboard has pretty much all but disappeared. Now we're onto our very final thing that we showed, which is the checkmark right here. So I'm going to call it check_marks because eventually there'll probably be quite a few of them hopefully if we do lots of good work, and our label is going to have to text which is going to have the checkmark. Now, if you are on a Mac, you can actually go into edit and go to emojis and symbols and pick a checkmark from here. But on Windows you can simply just use the trick that I showed you. Go ahead and copy and paste it from a piece of text, say like Wikipedia. Once we've got our texts, I'm going to change the foreground color of that text again, and I'm going to change it to green. And it's also going to require a background color of yellow just so that we get rid of the white. And finally, I'm going to add this on using the grid, setting the column to 1 and the row to 3. So this is basically going to be in the last row. So you can see after all of that work, we finally managed to complete the user interface and we've now achieved the final look. And all we need to do now is to actually add the timer functionality, which we'll do in the next lesson. Now, if you found any of the tkinter widgets difficult to use or you got stuck or you couldn't figure out certain things about it, then be sure to have a review of yesterday's lessons where we talked about the widgets in more detail. In the last lesson, we completed the user interface for our Pomodoro timer, and we've managed to get all the components that we need onto our graphical user interface. Now, the next step is to actually give it some functionality. I want to be able to create some sort of countdown mechanism that just does something really simple. For example, if it was just able to count down from five, four, three, two, one going down by one each time, that would be great. That's what we're going to be working on in this lesson. And we're going to go and see the countdown mechanism section to do that. One of the ways that you might think about approaching this is to use our time module cause we've seen before that we can say time.sleep and we can tell it to sleep for a second. So then we could maybe set up a while loop and while something or other is true, go ahead and sleep for one second. And then afterwards just, you know, subtract one from some sort of counter. So that we could start count at five and then each time we subtract by one and then each time we just simply update our label here, which we created in the canvas to whatever value count might be. Now, that sounds great in principle. The only problem is that we're working within a graphical user interface program. The reason why that's relevant is because if we think about a command line program, say for example, if we were to get our console to do something, print hello, well, it's only going to do something when you actually give it an instruction and you hit enter. It doesn't really need to keep an eye out for what you might do in between. But a graphical user interface is a little bit different. It needs to keep watching the screen to see whether if a user clicks on a button, for example. So it's basically going to refresh and keep listening for events. So every fraction of a second, it's going to keep checking, did something happene, did something happen, did something happen. And the moment when it does, then it's got to react. It's got to react to that event. In this case, we tend to call these types of GUI programs event-driven. And the way that it's driven is through our main loop. So when we set up our window and we start off the main loop, it's basically looping through and every millisecond it's checking to see did something happen, did something happen, did something happen? So that means if we have another loop in our program, it actually won't be able to reach the main loop. And in this case, when you actually try to run it, nothing happens. Our program doesn't even launch. So we have to rethink this and we have to do it a little bit differently. In order to create interactive and interesting programs, you kind of need something to happen on screen, right? Every so often. You need this timing mechanism. Luckily, tkinter already thought of this. And we can in fact use one of the builtin methods to every widget. So if we tap into our window widget, we can get hold of a method called after and after is quite simple. It's a method that takes an amount of time that it should wait and then after that amount of time, it simply calls a particular function that you tell it to call passing in any arguments that you want to give it. Here's how it works. We call window.after, we first provide the amount of time to wait in milliseconds. So if we want one second, then that's 1000 milliseconds. Next we pass in a function to call. So let's create a function up here. Let's just call it, say something, and then we'll pass in the thing, like this. And then all we do is we just print that thing. So super simple function. And then we give the name of this function as the function to call after 1000 milliseconds. Now the final thing in this list of arguments, if I just go ahead and cut that and show you again, when it gives me the prompt, the last thing is actually a *args. This, if you remember, allows us to put in an unlimited number of positional arguments. What that means is we can give as many arguments as we want and those arguments, in this case, is simply going to be passed to the function that we want to call. So in this case, it's going to be that thing. So if I put hello here then I run my code, you can see that after 1000 milliseconds, basically one second, it calls this function, say_something, and it passes this hello as the input to that function. As I said, you can have an infinite amount of positional arguments. So let's put in some other arguments which we'll call a, b, and c, and then we'll print a, print b, and print c. And now instead of passing in hello, we're going to pass in lots of positional parameters. So we'll say 3, 5, and 8. Now, when I hit run, you will see it waits for one second and then it passes all three of these parameters to say something and it goes ahead and prints all of those out at once. So this is how the after method works. But what we wanted to do though, is we want it to repeat itself, to essentially loop. One way of getting that behavior is to simply put this method, call somewhere inside a function and then call itself. So here's what I mean. Let's create a function called a count_down, and this is going to take a input in the form of the number to count down by. And then inside this function, we call window.after. And we say that after 1000 milliseconds, call this function count_down and then pass in a count number. If that count number started out as 5, then we want to say count - 1. Now all we have to do is to call this countdown method. So let's call count_down and passing the starting count, let's say 5 seconds. So now when I run the code, it's going to call this method passing in 5 over here, and then it's going to wait for one second, and then it's going to call this function count_down passing in five minus one so it becomes four. And then afterward it repeats again, becomes three, two, one. So now if we catch that number which we can print, then we'll be able to see it count down when we run the code; five, four, three, two, one. One every second, and it basically keeps on going and it even continues to the negatives. So if we don't want it to go to negative time, then all we have to do is add an if statement. If count is greater than zero, then go ahead and execute this line of code. So now it'll go from five, four, three, two, one, zero, and then it will stop. This is the kind of behavior that we would need if we want to update our countdown in our Pomodoro timer. So how can we instead of printing the count actually change this text on our canvas? We'll, the way that we do that is by assigning this text a variable. So I'm going to call it timer_text and now that we've got timer_text being a set as the text that was created in the canvas, then we can access it right here. And the way that we'd change a piece of text or anything for that matter in a canvas is slightly different from how we would do for a label. If it was just the title label that we wanted to change, we would say title_ label.config, and then let's change the text to something new. But to change a canvas element, you actually have to tap into the particular canvas you want to change and Then you call a method called itemconfig. And then in this method, you pass in the particular item that you actually want to configure, so in our case it's the timer_text, and then you pass in the thing about it that you actually want to change in terms of a kwarg, so this is a keyword argument. We're going to change the text to the current count. Now notice how this is not the string count, because then it would just show that word, but its actually the live countdown time. At this point in time if I run the code, I actually get a error and it tells us that the name canvas is not defined and that's because I'm calling this method countdown before I actually created the canvas. So if I move that to below this line and I run it again, then you'll see it actually work. And you see it starts out from five and it counts down to zero. Now how can we tie that behavior to the start button so that I can press the start button and then and only then does it start counting down from five, four, three, two, one? Well, let's go ahead and add another function and I'm gonna add it in the timer mechanism section and I'm going to call it start_timer. Now this function is super simple. All it's going to do is it's going to be responsible for calling that function countdown and it's going to count down from five seconds. So I'll move that inside the start_timer. And now the start timer is going to be the function that needs to be triggered when the start button gets pressed. Do you remember how to tie a function to a button in tkinter? Pause the video and see if you can solve this challenge so that you'll be able to run the code, hit start and the timer to start counting down. So the keyword argument is command and all we have to do is to tie it to the start_timer function, but without the parentheses. So now when I hit run and I click start, it starts the timer setting that text from five, four, three, two, one. So the main loop is listening and when the user interacts with the start button it actually calls the start_timer function which calls the count_down function and get it to count down from five seconds. Now we don't actually want to count down from five seconds. We want to count down in minutes because we're probably not going to be working for five seconds at a time. We're going to be working for 25 minutes or having a minute break. So how can I change this countdown to interpret this instead of as five seconds to five minutes? Well, let's have a think about that. If we wanted to count down, let's say one minute, then that in terms of seconds would be 60 seconds. All we have to do is to take the number of minutes that we want to count down by and multiply it by 60. In this case, if we wanted to count down it by five minutes instead of five seconds, all we have to do is multiply by 60. So then when we call this function count_down, instead of getting five seconds to count down, we get 300 seconds to count from. But now if we run our code, you can see it's going to start from 300. It's going to go down all the way down to zero. Now in terms of time, that is five minutes, but this is not a very good way to visualize it. Nobody thinks in terms of 288 seconds remaining, right? So we have to format this count so that we can display it in the format of you have one minute and 35 seconds remaining or something like that. So how can we create something like this? If we have the count in terms of seconds, so let's say we have 300, and we wanted to know how many minutes where in that then all we have to do is take 300 and then divide it by 60 and we would get 5, so that's 5 minutes. But what if the countdown has already been going and instead we had 245 seconds remaining? Well, we can actually get hold of how many minutes and seconds that is equivalent to. And the way we would do that is by taking that number, say 245, dividing it by 60 seconds and we would get a number 245 / 60 is 4.08, 3 recurring. If we rounded that number down to get rid of all of the decimal places, then that would be equal to 4 minutes. And then if we want to get hold of how many seconds there are after we've gotten hold of the four minutes, then the way we do that is to use the modular because remember the modular divides a number by another number, so 245 divided by 60, and then it will give us the remainder. How much is left after it's cleanly divided. And in this case, this would actually be the number of seconds remaining after the four minutes has been taken away. So let's write this code out. The count minutes would be the count divided by 60, but then we have to round it down so that we get rid of all of the remainder. Now we don't want to round it so that if it was something like 3.6 it becomes 4. We actually just want to get rid of everything after the decimal place. To do that, the easiest way is to import the math module and then use a function called math .floor and this math.floor, if I hover over it, is going to return the largest whole number that is less than or equal to x. If this was a 4.8, then the largest hole number less than 4.8 is 4. So that's basically what this is going to do. And this is going to give us the number of minutes. Now, the next thing we want to do is to know, well, how many seconds is left after we've taken away the minutes. To do this, we're going to do counts and then we're going to use the modulo to divide it by 60. So the modulo is going to give us the remainder number of seconds after we've cleanly divided it by 600. For example, if we had 100 seconds and we divide that by 60, well, that's going to be equal to one. So we can minus 60 from 100 and we get 40 as the remainder. That is what we will get after doing the modulo. So that's basically the number of seconds that remains. So now that we've got the minute and the second, we can actually change this count to use an f-string and we can format it so that we add the count minute first, and then we add a colon and then we add our count in seconds. Now look at what happens. We're going to try and count down five minutes. So we get hold of the number of seconds, we pass it over to this function, we work out what the count is equivalent to in minutes and seconds and then afterwards we subtract one second each time. So now when I run the code and I hit start, notice how it starts from 5 minutes, goes down to 4 minutes, 50, 59, and then it keeps ongoing like a real timer. That's pretty cool. The only thing left to figure out is how can we get it to not display 5:0? How can we get it to display 5:00 like you would see on a clock? To find out how to do that we have to learn about Python dynamic typing. We have to understand how that works and that is what we're going to be talking about in the next lesson. So I'll see you there. In the last lesson, we managed to get our countdown mechanism to work, and we got it to count down from five minutes to zero. Now, everything works, but there's just something a little bit niggling and you'll see it when I hit start. Notice how it says 5:0. Wouldn't it be so much better if it said 5:00? So how would we do that? Well, that is the zero comes from this count_sec because it's taking the count in seconds, dividing it by 60 and finding the remainder using the modulo. Now, when there is no remainder, it's just going to be equal to zero. So we could use an if statement and check well if the count_sec is equal to zero, then instead of making it zero, let's set it to equal a string which is \"00\". Now this actually, believe it or not, works. And you'll see it when I run it. When I hit start, doesn't that look so much better? But some of you might've realized that there's something a little bit crazy going on here in these two lines of code. We're checking to see if this variable holds data that is equal to the integer, the whole number zero, and then we're setting it to a string. So these are completely two different data types. That's an int and that is a string. So how is it that we're able to do this? So let me pull up the Python console. We know that if we took a integer, say 3, and we try to add it to a string, say a 4, this is not going to work and we get a type error because this is type int and this is type string. So you can't actually add these two together because there's a mismatch. Now here's the crazy thing. Let's create a variable a and let's make it hold the integer with 3. And at this point, you can see that this a variable has a data type of int. If I decide to change that variable and make it hold a different type of data, let's say the number 4, or let's make it simpler, let's make it hold the piece of text, Hello. As soon as that goes through, you can see that a is now of data type string. And the very fact that I'm able to do that, change a variable's data type by changing the content in that variable, this is what's known as dynamic typing. In this sense, Python is a language that's quite unique because on one hand it is strongly typed, in the sense that it holds on to the data type of the variable, so this a is a string and it knows that it's a string and if you do something that is not meant for a string, say if you try to raise a to the power of 2, then that is going to be a type error. Types matter and when you call a function that's expecting a particular type, say if you use the power function which is expecting a integer and you pass in something that's obviously not an integer say, our string here and you try to get it to do some things, say raise it to the power of 3, then again, we get type error. It knows what type is supposed to go into that function and it makes sure that you comply with that. This is where the language is strongly typed. But the part where the language is dynamically typed is that even though it knows what type a variable is, it knows what type a function expects, you can also dynamically change the data type of any variable like this. That is basically what we're using here. We're using dynamic typing to change the data type of count_sec from a integer to a string. And then we use that string to display inside this canvas text. Now there is however, still a bit of a bug with this and you'll see it once it dips below 10 seconds. Notice that as soon as it goes to 9 seconds, instead of saying 09, which is what you would want or 08, 06, it just lists the number of seconds until it reaches 00. So how can we fix this? The key lies in these two lines of code. See if you can do this as a challenge, pause the video and see if you can make it so that when it's nine seconds remaining, it says 09 or 08 or 07 and also 00 of course. Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge. All right. So basically what we want to check for is when the count in seconds is less than 10, because now it's going to be in the single digits and instead of having just one digit, we wanna add a zero in front of it. So the way we can do this is through just an f-string. We can use an f-string to add the zero in front and then add the count in seconds afterwards, formatting that into the standard kind of time format. Now that we fixed that if we run our app again it goes down to 10 seconds you can see it now says 09, 08, 07 and it's nicely formatted using our f-string. And we're able to do because of the flexibility of the data types in Python, checking it as a number, making sure it's less than 10 and then formatting it as a string and using the f-string. Now, this is not a feature that's available in all programming languages. For example, languages like C or Java or Swift, you won't be able to do this. Once you create a variable and you give it a certain type of data, then it must forever hold on to that type of data. But Python allows you to change the data type of a variable just by assigning it to a different type of value. There's a really well-worded Stack Overflow answer that addresses this exact thing I'm talking about, talking about the fact that Python is a strongly dynamically typed language. And I recommend that if you want to dig more into this, to have a read of this answer and I'll link to this in the course resources. Now we're almost there. When we hit start, our countdown works and it starts counting down from however minutes we tell it to. Here's a challenge for you. We know that the Pomodoro technique requires us to work for 25 minutes and then after 25 minutes to take a short break, and then it goes back to 25 and this repeats until we've done four sets of 25 minutes, and then we get a long break. So I want you to have a think about how you could create a variable called reps, which is going to be a global variable, and you can access it inside start_timer by tapping into this global reps. Now using the modulo or some other sort of mechanism that you can think of see if you can figure out how to get our countdown timer to count down a different number of minutes. For example, we would start out with work_seconds which is going to be the work in minutes times 60, and then we have our short_break_sec and our long break seconds. Now, how can we call this countdown timer so that if it's the first third, fifth, seventh, rep that we're actually doing our countdown, then we want this countdown to do our 25 minutes in terms of work seconds. But on the other hand, if it is, um, the eighth rep, then we want the countdown to work on our long break seconds. But if it's the second or fourth or sixth rep then it should count down to our short break seconds. Essentially what we're trying to achieve is for our countdown timer to do 25 minutes, then 5 minutes, then 25, 5, and until we've done four sets of 25, then do we get a 20 minute break. So have a think about what you've done before using the modulo and see if you can figure out how to get this to work in your code. Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge. All right. So what we want to do is first when we start the timer to increase the reps. So we're going to increase it by one. So now it starts out at the first rep or the first repetition. Now on this first repetition, it's going to need to run this particular line of code. And then when it gets to the second repetition, it needs to run this line of code. And finally, when it gets to the eighth repetition then it needs to run this line of code. So we can actually use a if statement to check for all of these things. So here we can check to see if the reps modulo by 8 is equal to zero. If the number of reps divided by 8 has no remainder, then that means it's actually the time for a long break. Now, Elif though, or else if the reps is actually even, so if modulo 2 is equal to zero, then in this case it should be time for a short break. And finally, if it's none of those conditions and we have an else statement, then it's just a normal work time. Now we might think that's all that's required, but as usual we have to test it to be sure. So let's go ahead and change our work minute down to one minute so that we can run it and have a reasonable chance of seeing when it actually finally reaches zero. Once our timer counter goes down to zero, we would expect it to go to a five minute break, but it doesn't. It actually just stops. And this is why we need to test our code and test our programs as frequently as we write code so that we can catch these bugs in terms of our logic. So what's happening here? Well, basically it's counting down to the number of seconds that we told it to count down to. And then once it's done that, well, that's kind of the end. There's no other way of triggering start timer unless we press the button. So what we actually need to do is to add a else statement here and catch when the count goes to zero, because it's in that moment that we want to actually call start timer once again. And this time it's going to increase the reps and figure out which countdown we actually need to go to. So if we run this code again and I fast forward through the timer, you can see that now, once it hits zero, it's going to go straight to our five minute break and it continues the timer. Now, as the user though, it's quite hard to tell whether if I'm in a work section or if I'm in a break section and what's actually going on. So we should improve the user experience by changing this title from saying timer to whatever it is that the user should be doing. So if they are in this long break countdown then it should say break, if they're in a short break section it should say break, and if they're in the work section then it should say work. So the label that we need to change is this title label. And I also want to change the color, the foreground color, so that when it's work, it's green, when its a short break it's pink, when it was a long break it's red. So of course, I'm referring to these constants over here. See if you can complete this as a challenge and get that label to change to display to the user, what they should be doing each time. Pause the video and complete this challenge. Okay. So when they're on a long break, we're going to get our title label to configure it and change the text to say break. And we're also going to configure the foreground color at the same time and we're going to make this the red color. Now for the next one, which is the short break, it's also going to read break, but in this case, the foreground color is going to be pink. And finally, when they should be working, the foreground color is going to be green and the label is going to read work. So now when it's during a work session, it will say work. And when it switches to the break time, then it's going to say break. And because this is pink, this is, of course, the short break where we can also see that we've got five minutes and counting. And when it gets to the long break after four sessions of work, then the text would be red and the countdown would show 20 minutes. We're pretty much almost there. There's just a couple of loose ends to tie off. One is to change this part so that we actually get a checkmark for every successful work session we complete, and also to make sure that our reset button works so that when we click on it, the timer stops and goes back to zero. So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson. Now we're at the final stretch. Our Pomodoro program is almost complete. We've got this beautiful user interface, we've got beautiful colors from our colorhunt.io color palette, and we've got pretty much everything functioning other than just some loose ends. So the first thing I want to fix is the section with the check marks. So we've created the checkmarks which is a label that currently just contains a single checkmark. Now I'm actually going to cut this checkmark and delete the text here because I want that label to start out as empty. Now, the only time when I want that label to get an extra check mark is when the user has completed a work countdown. So once they've completed their 25 minute session, then they should get that checkmark. To do that I'm going to write the code inside this else statement because every single time a countdown completes, it's going to go into this else statement because the count goes down to zero. Now, currently we're just getting the timer to restart itself and go to the next session. But what we want to do here is we want to check to see how many reps we have, and for every two reps then that means we've completed one work session because it's work then rest, then work, then rest. So for every two reps, we've completed one 25 minute work session. So here's a challenge for you. So have a think about how you can use our variable reps to check so that for every two reps we've completed, we add a checkmark to this checkmark label. Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge, then test it out and see if you managed to get it right. Okay. All right. So we know that the reps is equal to the number of sessions we've had. So for example, if we've done for reps, then that means we've had two work sessions and two breaks. That means we can basically divide reps by two to get the total number of work sessions we've done. What I can do is I can create a temporary variable called mark, which is just going to be in an empty string to start off. And then I can create a for loop to loop through a range. And the range is going to go from zero up to our reps divided by 2. Now this is giving us a warning at the moment because reps divided by 2 or anything divided by anything becomes a floating type number. In our case we want to do is we want to use that math.floor again so that we can floor this reps divided by 2 to a whole number and that way we get the correct number of work sessions. If you want to make this a little bit more clear the next time you read your code, you can actually create a work_sessions and we can move this part of our code over to here. So the total number of work sessions is equal to the reps divided by 2 and then rounded down to the nearest integer. And then we can use that number of work sessions to create our range. When we've created our range, we know that this loop is going to run for that many times. So we can add to our mark. For every single time the loop runs, I'm going to paste in a checkmark. You should have that checkmark that you had from a previously, and you can paste it into here. Now, once we've completed that loop, then all we need to do is the update our checkmarks label by calling config and then changing the text to equal our mark. Now, in this case, it probably makes sense for that to actually be plural. So I'm gonna use my refactor -> rename to just add an 's' to everywhere I'm using this. Now let's test it out. When I hit start, it should start counting down. And once that work session completes, then you'll see the timer go to zero and our first checkmark show up. And for every work session we complete, we get an extra checkmark just to nudge us towards working a little bit harder. The final thing that I want to address is our reset mechanism. So we have this lovely reset button, but it's not really doing anything at the moment. What I'm going to do is create a new function here which I'll call reset_timer. And what this reset_timer is going to do is basically it's going to reset all the checkmarks, reset the text inside the timer, stop the timer and change this title back to the text that it originally had, which is just the word timer. Now, the hardest part about this is actually stopping the timer because what we have to do is we actually need to tap into that window.after again. But instead of calling after, we actually want to call after_cancel. This way we can actually cancel the timer that we had set up previously. This is the thing that we want to cancel. And if we want to cancel it, we have to give it a name and we have to put it inside a variable. So I'm going to call this my timer. But because this is going to be a local variable because it's created inside this particular function, I actually have to bring it out. I have to make it a global variable, so after create it up here, but what value do I give it? Well, initially, it's actually not going to have any value at all. So it's going to start out as none. And then later on, I'm going to tap into that global timer in order to get it to hold on to this. Now, then once I want to reset my timer and cancel it, well then I can actually tap into this global timer and stop the timer. So now to actually activate this function, reset_timer, we have to add it as a command to our reset button. So where we create our button, I'm gonna add it as a command. And remember, we have to get rid of the parentheses. So now if I run my program and I start my timer, you can see that as soon as I click this reset button, it stops my timer and it doesn't continue. So now all we have to do is the add all of the things that we have to reset, for example, the text in here, we want that to read 00. So that was the timer_text from our canvas. And then the other thing we want to do is the title label. We want to set that to just read timer. And finally, we want to reset our check marks so that once you hit the reset button, it resets this title label, the timer text here stops the timer and gets rid of all the checkmarks, like this. Pause the video and give that a go. Alright. So the first thing we want to change is our timer text. And because the timer text is created in the canvas, we have a slightly different way of changing that. So we call canvas.itemconfig, and then pass in the thing that we want to change, which is the timer text. And then the attribute that we want to change, which is it's text. And then we change that to just say 00:00, go back to the beginning. Now the title label is a lot easier to change. We can say title_label.config, and then we can configure its text to basically just read timer. Finally, we're going to reset our checkmarks. So we tap into our checkmarks' label again, using config to change the text back to empty. However, there's still a slight problem with our code. What happens if while our timer is counting down I hit the reset button and then hit the start button again? Did you spot that? Our timer jumped from \"Work\" to \"Break\" because our reps are still increasing. So far we haven't reset the number of reps to zero when we reset the timer. So all we need to do to fix this bug is add:",
      "if you didn't hear me talk about it, this is basically a very simple breakdown. Essentially, you figure out the task that you need to do something hard, something that takes a while like writing your next book or coding up a project. And then you want to set your timer to the 25 minutes and then work on the task for 25 minutes. And then after that, you take a short five-minute break. And after you've done four of these Pomodoros, basically four repetition, then you get to take a 15 to 30 minute break. So this basically really effectively utilizes the way that our brain works to take short breaks often and to work for 25 minutes at a time, which helps us with information retention and also keeping up the motivation. This is the program that we're going to be building using tkinter. It's going to be a timer with a tomato on it. And when you click start, it's going to tell you to work for 25 minutes. Then that window can go into the background and while you're writing your code or doing whatever, when the timer's up, it will pop to the very front of the screen above all of the other windows and tell you to take a break. So the first break is for five minutes and you'll notice here, we've already achieved one check mark for our first Pomodoro completed. And once you're done with the break, then it's going to go back to work and it's going to continue until you reach the longer break or until you click reset to stop and reset the timer. Effectively, it's going to help you do these Pomodoros where you have 25-minute work, 5-minute break. You do four of these 25-minute work sessions, and then you get a 20-minute break. So hopefully by creating this program, you're going to increase your productivity and you're going to have your own handy tool to help you achieve more and do more. So this is what we're going to be building. Once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and let's get started. The first thing I want you to do to get started is to head over to the course resources and download the starting files for the Pomodoro project. Once you've got that, then you should be able to unzip this file and get hold of the starting folder. Next, I want you to open up that folder using PyCharm. So in my case, my folder's inside my downloads, and then I'll just click open. And PyCharm should automatically configure the latest version of Python you've got installed. So if you take a look inside this folder, there's two files. There is a image of a tomato which we're going to use in our project, and there's also a main.py with a couple of sections already hashed out for you. And we've also included some constants, like some color hex codes or a font name or the number of minutes for working short breaks in a long breaks. So that's already in the starting file. The first thing we're going to do is to set up our UI. So under the section UI set up, we're going to create a new window using tkinter and we're going to get the window to run and give it a background color, pretty simple. So let's go to the top of our file and import our tkinter module. And then if we scroll down to our UI setup section, let's go ahead and create a new window from the tk class. Remember that our tk class is one of the classes from tkinter so you can either tap into the tkinter module and then get hold of the tk class like I have done here, or as in our case, if we're going to be using a lot of classes from tkinter then we can simply say from tkinter let's go ahead and import all of the classes. So that way we can straight away refer to this tk class. Now that we've created our window, the next thing we can do is to set the title of the window, which you can of course call it anything you want. But in my case, I'm going to set it to just Pomodoro, which just means tomato in Italian. So now that we've got our Pomodoro, then we're going to get our window to show up by using window.main loop as usual. And now if we run this, code our main, and you can see we've got a blank window, a title, and we're ready to go to the next step. The next step is to put an image into our program so that we can have this tomato as the background of our program, and then we can put some text on top which is going to signify our countdown timer. This is what we're aiming for, but to achieve this and to be able to put images onto the screen which look like this, we're going to have to learn about the tkinter canvas widget. A canvas widget is a little bit like a real life canvas, really. It allows you to layer things one on top of the others. So you could draw something and then you can draw something on top of that. And what it allows us to do in our case is to place an image onto our program and then to place some text straight on top of that. In between our window creation and the window main loop is where we're going to create our canvas. And our canvas is created using the canvas widget of course. One of the things that we can specify when we create our canvas is a width and a height, and that will be a value in terms of pixels. So we know that we want to display this tomato image inside that canvas. And we can see that this has a, roughly a width of 200 and a height of 223. So let's create a canvas that's roughly about the same size as the image. So we'll put a width of 200 and a height of 224 so that we work with some even numbers. Once I've created my canvas the next thing I want to do is to add my image to it. And we can use a method that the canvas has it which is called create_image. And as soon as I type create, you can see there's actually a whole bunch of other methods like create the text in the canvas, create a rectangle, create an oval. And all of these things could be overlapped on each other inside the same canvas. Now, when we create an image, there's a couple of things which are required. The first thing is the X and Y positions of this image in the canvas. Given that we have a width of 200 and a height of 224, I want my image to be bang in the center of the canvas. So I can provide the X value as half of the width and the Y value as half of the height. In addition to the X and Y values, we also have to specify a image. But I can't just simply just type the name of my image which is tomato.png, because that is not the type of data that this argument is expecting. What it wants instead is something called a photo image and this class comes from tkinter and it's basically a way to read through a file and to get hold of a particular image at a particular file location. In my case, the file location is in fact tomato.png. And if your image was stored in say another sub folder or a different place, then you should provide the relative or absolute file path to get there from where your code is, which is the main.py. But in our case it's very easy, they're both in the same folder, so we can simply specify our filename like so. The next thing we're going to do is we're going to save this photo image in a variable so we can refer to it later on. I'm going to call this our tomato_img. Feel free to call it anything you want. And that is the data that goes into this image argument. Now we've created our canvas, we've created our photo image, we've told our canvas to create an image at this position, and then we've put the image inside. The final thing we need to do is to pack our canvas or use some other sort of method to specify the layout of how the canvas is going to go on the screen. And now we can hit run, and we can see our image on the screen. So now notice how the image is basically taking up the entire space of the window. And in fact, the window is resizing itself to fit this image. Wouldn't it be better if this screen was actually a little bit bigger? So we don't just look at the image of a tomato. We can do that by getting our window to be configured. And the configuration that we want to change is the padding, so I'm going to change the padx and pady. On the X-axis on the horizontal I'm actually going to add a whole hundred pixels of padding on both sides. And then on the Yaxis, pady, I'm going to change that to 50 so that it's got 50 pixels of padding on the top. That's looking pretty good other than one small defect. You can see that our tomato image is a little bit cut off on the left and I suspect this is because the actual image is a little bit shifted over to the left. So we can actually adjust this X position to be a little bit more to the right, and that way our tomato can be centered on screen without being cut off on either side. So now that we've tweaked our image and we've displayed it on the screen, the next thing to do is to display some text. As you noticed before, in addition to canvas.create_image, they will a whole bunch of other things we could create, including some texts. This create_text method works very similarly to the create_image method. Notice how the first thing that's getting highlighted is the *args. And then we've got our **kw. So remember from the lessons yesterday, these arguments are the unlimited positional arguments and these arguments are the unlimited keyword arguments. So the keyword arguments here are for example the image or the background color or anything else, but these are the X and Y values. So creating the text, we also have to provide a X and Y value. So I'm just going to try the same values as the image to see how that looks. And now we can add some keyword arguments, for example, the text. So I just want it to say 00:00, which looks pretty much like the clock. Now, if we run our code, you can see we've got a little bit of text showing up. Now, notice how it's a little bit high up on the tomato, because remember the tomato starts at the top here and ends here. So that is the center of the tomato image, but we can move it down a little bit so that it's actually centered in this red part, the circular part. With a little bit of experimentation, I think this, 103, 130, actually works quite well and it's pretty much bang in the center of the tomato. Let's modify this text in some other ways. We can change the fill which is basically the color of the text and I'm going to change that to white, that you can see here. And then I'm going to change the font as well. And this is going to expect a tuple. So it's going to be the font name and then the size, and then whether, if it's bold or italic or whatever else you want to do. Now in the constants here, I've already got the font name defined, which is gonna be Courier that we're gonna be using. So that we can straight up add our font name and then we'll add a font size as 35, and it will say, yeah, make it bold. So there you have it. We've got our tomato, we've got our text showing up as the countdown timer. Now, the final thing I want to do is just to change the background color to a slightly nicer looking color. Now, one of my favorite websites is this one called colorhunt.io, which shows you a whole bunch of different color palettes that professional designers have a created and it makes it really easy for us to just snap up some of these hex codes and use them straight away in our program. Now, the one that really caught my eye is this one, cause it has a bit of the tomato color palette. So I've transferred all of these hex codes to the constants in the starting file. So you can see I've got the pink, the red, the green, the yellow, and we're going to be using that across our program to give it that consistent color theme and make it look like it's been professionally designed. So what I want to do is I want to change the window's background color, and I can do that through the keyword argument called at bg for background, and I can set it to a hex code. So a hex code starts out with the pound sign and then it's some numbers and some letters. Now I've already got all of that for you and all you have to do is just to put down the name of the constant. So this should not be in quotation marks because it's not the word. It is in fact, referring to that particular variable and the string that's held inside. So now if we check our screen, you can see the background has been changed to that nice yellow color, sort of rice or hay color, but the tomato, namely the canvas, still has that white background. So let's change the background color of the canvas as well. And again, it's using the bg. So some of these, you'll notice, are standard attributes that we can change like the width and the height and the background color, which is standard across all of the widgets. And some other things like file here are some of the more specific keyword arguments. So let's apply this yellow to the background of the canvas, and you can see that the canvas is now yellow as well. But it's still got this little white border which denotes the edges of our canvas. To get rid of that I found a specific keyword argument that would actually help and it took quite a bit of digging around, quite a bit of Stack Overflow searching and googling in order to find this. It wasn't very straightforward because tkinter is not well-documented unfortunately. But thankfully for you, all you have to do is find your canvas and on the line where you've created it, go ahead and add this keyword argument. It's called a highlightthickness, and be sure that you spell it right, because it's really long. And remember that there's two Ts cause it's highlight and thickness and there's nothing in between, no underscore, no nothing to separate it. I think that the tkinter team could have really done a little bit better here, but hey. If we set the highlightthickness to zero and we rerun our code, then you should see that it now looks pretty good. And our canvas is now completely the same color as the background of the window. And you can't tell it where the window begins and the canvas ends. Now, the only problem is once we've removed that border around the canvas, our tomato is once again, shifted a little bit. So we can actually adjust this and we can change this back to 100 and I'm going to change it both for the text and the image. And we can make that tomato image perfectly round once more. With tkinter I've found that you have to do quite a bit of tweaking around especially with these positions. And you'll spend some time judging it by eye in terms of the size and the width and where to place it. But we have now successfully managed to place an image onto the screen, changed the background of the window, keep it consistent and add a little bit of text onto our tomato. So now we're ready for the next step. In the next lesson, we're going to create the rest of the user interface. And that is mostly going to be up to you. So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson. In the last lesson, we started setting up our user interface and we created this canvas, placed our image onto it, and also on top of that, put some text. This is how far we've gotten, and we want to now complete setting up the user interface, so adding in some more components. And we wanted to end up looking a bit like this with a label at the top, a big bit of text, some buttons at the bottom, and also a label that keeps track of how many Pomodoros we've done. So each 25 minute work session gets us a check mark. So you are going to be using a lot of the stuff that you learned in yesterday's lessons in terms of which tkinter widgets to use and how to set them up in order to create this. So it's going to be a challenge for you, but before we get started, there's just a couple of things I want to point out. So, one thing to note is that we've got this bg which stands for background color, and we've used our constants up here to set those background colors. Now you can see that here I've got the label and also the check mark in a green color. And that color comes from our constant right here. So you'll be able to color a piece of text in a label, not by using bg, but by using fg which stands for a foreground. And that you can basically set to equal the green color that we've got. And as long as that's added to the label, then you should be able to see that show up. Now, the other thing I want to show you is if you don't know how to get hold of a check mark, the easiest way is just to go onto Wikipedia and find the particular checkmark that you like. And then just copy it and paste it into here as the text. So for example, if we had a label which had a text argument, and I copy that a checkmark and I paste it here, then that checkmark is what's going to show up on screen. Now, the final thing I want to mention before I let you get on with the challenge is that we've packed our canvas onto the screen. But as we've got quite a few things that we need to lay out on the screen, it's much easier to do this using the grid. So I want you to change the canvas to using the grid system. And here I've created a more or less sort of breakdown of how that grid might look like. So you probably will end up with one, two, three, four rows and three columns, and have a think about how you might lay out the labels and the buttons and the check marks relative to those rows and columns. Keeping this page on screen, I want you to pause the video and give this challenge it go. And if you don't know the sizes for things or the fonts, don't worry, just guess them. It doesn't really matter. As long as you've got the rough layout and the correct widgets, then that would be considered a win. Pause the video now and give it a go. All right. So I'm going to get started by creating this top label here and that I'm going to call the title_label and that's going to be created from the label class. Now, the text in this is just going to read timer for now, and I want to change its color by using the foreground keyword argument. And I'm going to change it to that green color that we've got up here. Now, I want to be able to show that label on screen, so I have to give it some form of layout. And as we mentioned, we're going to use the grid system. So I'm going to change the grid. And if we refer to this image, you can see there's going to be three columns. This is going to be in the middle column, and then it's going to be on the first row. So that we're going to start from zero. So I'm going to say column = 1 and row = 0. Now I have to change this canvas pack because otherwise it's going to give me an error. And in terms of where the canvas is, it's going to be again in the same column as that label, but it's going to be on the next row. So column 1, row 1. And now when I run it, you can see our label shows up and then our canvas shows up and it's all correctly positioned. Now I want to change this label so that it looks a little bit more like the demo that I showed you, like this. So I have to change the font and the text to make it a lot bigger. As we've seen before, we can simply add the font when we create the label. So we can set that to a tuple. And first I'm going to use my font name that I've got as a constant which I've used when I created the text, it's just going to be Courier. And then in terms of the size, you can simply just make a guess. It's going to be something pretty large. So I'm going to go with 50 and I'm not going to have it bold or italic or anything, so that's the end of that font. And now when I run it again, you can see its a lot bigger and it looks a lot more like the example that we had here. But the only difference is that it actually still has a white background. Instead of just changing the foreground, I'm also going to change the background and I'm going to make it the same yellow color that I have in the background of the window. So now it looks like it's all blended in and it's all a part of the same application. Let's move on to the next row, which is going to be our buttons. So I'm going to have a start button and I'm also going to have a reset button and they're both going to be created from the button class. The start button is just going to have the text start and the reset button is going to have the word reset. The start button is also going to be laid out on our grid and it's going to be column 0 row 2. And the reset button is going to be column 2, row 2. So now you can see the start and the reset buttons are now on the next row after the canvas and it's either side of it. Now notice how there's a little bit of a white background around each of the buttons. If that bothers you, then you can actually fix that by doing the same thing that we did with the canvas which got rid of the border by changing that highlightthickness to zero. And because that's really prone to typos, I'm actually just going to paste it in. So now you can see that whiteboard has pretty much all but disappeared. Now we're onto our very final thing that we showed, which is the checkmark right here. So I'm going to call it check_marks because eventually there'll probably be quite a few of them hopefully if we do lots of good work, and our label is going to have to text which is going to have the checkmark. Now, if you are on a Mac, you can actually go into edit and go to emojis and symbols and pick a checkmark from here. But on Windows you can simply just use the trick that I showed you. Go ahead and copy and paste it from a piece of text, say like Wikipedia. Once we've got our texts, I'm going to change the foreground color of that text again, and I'm going to change it to green. And it's also going to require a background color of yellow just so that we get rid of the white. And finally, I'm going to add this on using the grid, setting the column to 1 and the row to 3. So this is basically going to be in the last row. So you can see after all of that work, we finally managed to complete the user interface and we've now achieved the final look. And all we need to do now is to actually add the timer functionality, which we'll do in the next lesson. Now, if you found any of the tkinter widgets difficult to use or you got stuck or you couldn't figure out certain things about it, then be sure to have a review of yesterday's lessons where we talked about the widgets in more detail. In the last lesson, we completed the user interface for our Pomodoro timer, and we've managed to get all the components that we need onto our graphical user interface. Now, the next step is to actually give it some functionality. I want to be able to create some sort of countdown mechanism that just does something really simple. For example, if it was just able to count down from five, four, three, two, one going down by one each time, that would be great. That's what we're going to be working on in this lesson. And we're going to go and see the countdown mechanism section to do that. One of the ways that you might think about approaching this is to use our time module cause we've seen before that we can say time.sleep and we can tell it to sleep for a second. So then we could maybe set up a while loop and while something or other is true, go ahead and sleep for one second. And then afterwards just, you know, subtract one from some sort of counter. So that we could start count at five and then each time we subtract by one and then each time we just simply update our label here, which we created in the canvas to whatever value count might be. Now, that sounds great in principle. The only problem is that we're working within a graphical user interface program. The reason why that's relevant is because if we think about a command line program, say for example, if we were to get our console to do something, print hello, well, it's only going to do something when you actually give it an instruction and you hit enter. It doesn't really need to keep an eye out for what you might do in between. But a graphical user interface is a little bit different. It needs to keep watching the screen to see whether if a user clicks on a button, for example. So it's basically going to refresh and keep listening for events. So every fraction of a second, it's going to keep checking, did something happene, did something happen, did something happen. And the moment when it does, then it's got to react. It's got to react to that event. In this case, we tend to call these types of GUI programs event-driven. And the way that it's driven is through our main loop. So when we set up our window and we start off the main loop, it's basically looping through and every millisecond it's checking to see did something happen, did something happen, did something happen? So that means if we have another loop in our program, it actually won't be able to reach the main loop. And in this case, when you actually try to run it, nothing happens. Our program doesn't even launch. So we have to rethink this and we have to do it a little bit differently. In order to create interactive and interesting programs, you kind of need something to happen on screen, right? Every so often. You need this timing mechanism. Luckily, tkinter already thought of this. And we can in fact use one of the builtin methods to every widget. So if we tap into our window widget, we can get hold of a method called after and after is quite simple. It's a method that takes an amount of time that it should wait and then after that amount of time, it simply calls a particular function that you tell it to call passing in any arguments that you want to give it. Here's how it works. We call window.after, we first provide the amount of time to wait in milliseconds. So if we want one second, then that's 1000 milliseconds. Next we pass in a function to call. So let's create a function up here. Let's just call it, say something, and then we'll pass in the thing, like this. And then all we do is we just print that thing. So super simple function. And then we give the name of this function as the function to call after 1000 milliseconds. Now the final thing in this list of arguments, if I just go ahead and cut that and show you again, when it gives me the prompt, the last thing is actually a *args. This, if you remember, allows us to put in an unlimited number of positional arguments. What that means is we can give as many arguments as we want and those arguments, in this case, is simply going to be passed to the function that we want to call. So in this case, it's going to be that thing. So if I put hello here then I run my code, you can see that after 1000 milliseconds, basically one second, it calls this function, say_something, and it passes this hello as the input to that function. As I said, you can have an infinite amount of positional arguments. So let's put in some other arguments which we'll call a, b, and c, and then we'll print a, print b, and print c. And now instead of passing in hello, we're going to pass in lots of positional parameters. So we'll say 3, 5, and 8. Now, when I hit run, you will see it waits for one second and then it passes all three of these parameters to say something and it goes ahead and prints all of those out at once. So this is how the after method works. But what we wanted to do though, is we want it to repeat itself, to essentially loop. One way of getting that behavior is to simply put this method, call somewhere inside a function and then call itself. So here's what I mean. Let's create a function called a count_down, and this is going to take a input in the form of the number to count down by. And then inside this function, we call window.after. And we say that after 1000 milliseconds, call this function count_down and then pass in a count number. If that count number started out as 5, then we want to say count - 1. Now all we have to do is to call this countdown method. So let's call count_down and passing the starting count, let's say 5 seconds. So now when I run the code, it's going to call this method passing in 5 over here, and then it's going to wait for one second, and then it's going to call this function count_down passing in five minus one so it becomes four. And then afterward it repeats again, becomes three, two, one. So now if we catch that number which we can print, then we'll be able to see it count down when we run the code; five, four, three, two, one. One every second, and it basically keeps on going and it even continues to the negatives. So if we don't want it to go to negative time, then all we have to do is add an if statement. If count is greater than zero, then go ahead and execute this line of code. So now it'll go from five, four, three, two, one, zero, and then it will stop. This is the kind of behavior that we would need if we want to update our countdown in our Pomodoro timer. So how can we instead of printing the count actually change this text on our canvas? We'll, the way that we do that is by assigning this text a variable. So I'm going to call it timer_text and now that we've got timer_text being a set as the text that was created in the canvas, then we can access it right here. And the way that we'd change a piece of text or anything for that matter in a canvas is slightly different from how we would do for a label. If it was just the title label that we wanted to change, we would say title_ label.config, and then let's change the text to something new. But to change a canvas element, you actually have to tap into the particular canvas you want to change and Then you call a method called itemconfig. And then in this method, you pass in the particular item that you actually want to configure, so in our case it's the timer_text, and then you pass in the thing about it that you actually want to change in terms of a kwarg, so this is a keyword argument. We're going to change the text to the current count. Now notice how this is not the string count, because then it would just show that word, but its actually the live countdown time. At this point in time if I run the code, I actually get a error and it tells us that the name canvas is not defined and that's because I'm calling this method countdown before I actually created the canvas. So if I move that to below this line and I run it again, then you'll see it actually work. And you see it starts out from five and it counts down to zero. Now how can we tie that behavior to the start button so that I can press the start button and then and only then does it start counting down from five, four, three, two, one? Well, let's go ahead and add another function and I'm gonna add it in the timer mechanism section and I'm going to call it start_timer. Now this function is super simple. All it's going to do is it's going to be responsible for calling that function countdown and it's going to count down from five seconds. So I'll move that inside the start_timer. And now the start timer is going to be the function that needs to be triggered when the start button gets pressed. Do you remember how to tie a function to a button in tkinter? Pause the video and see if you can solve this challenge so that you'll be able to run the code, hit start and the timer to start counting down. So the keyword argument is command and all we have to do is to tie it to the start_timer function, but without the parentheses. So now when I hit run and I click start, it starts the timer setting that text from five, four, three, two, one. So the main loop is listening and when the user interacts with the start button it actually calls the start_timer function which calls the count_down function and get it to count down from five seconds. Now we don't actually want to count down from five seconds. We want to count down in minutes because we're probably not going to be working for five seconds at a time. We're going to be working for 25 minutes or having a minute break. So how can I change this countdown to interpret this instead of as five seconds to five minutes? Well, let's have a think about that. If we wanted to count down, let's say one minute, then that in terms of seconds would be 60 seconds. All we have to do is to take the number of minutes that we want to count down by and multiply it by 60. In this case, if we wanted to count down it by five minutes instead of five seconds, all we have to do is multiply by 60. So then when we call this function count_down, instead of getting five seconds to count down, we get 300 seconds to count from. But now if we run our code, you can see it's going to start from 300. It's going to go down all the way down to zero. Now in terms of time, that is five minutes, but this is not a very good way to visualize it. Nobody thinks in terms of 288 seconds remaining, right? So we have to format this count so that we can display it in the format of you have one minute and 35 seconds remaining or something like that. So how can we create something like this? If we have the count in terms of seconds, so let's say we have 300, and we wanted to know how many minutes where in that then all we have to do is take 300 and then divide it by 60 and we would get 5, so that's 5 minutes. But what if the countdown has already been going and instead we had 245 seconds remaining? Well, we can actually get hold of how many minutes and seconds that is equivalent to. And the way we would do that is by taking that number, say 245, dividing it by 60 seconds and we would get a number 245 / 60 is 4.08, 3 recurring. If we rounded that number down to get rid of all of the decimal places, then that would be equal to 4 minutes. And then if we want to get hold of how many seconds there are after we've gotten hold of the four minutes, then the way we do that is to use the modular because remember the modular divides a number by another number, so 245 divided by 60, and then it will give us the remainder. How much is left after it's cleanly divided. And in this case, this would actually be the number of seconds remaining after the four minutes has been taken away. So let's write this code out. The count minutes would be the count divided by 60, but then we have to round it down so that we get rid of all of the remainder. Now we don't want to round it so that if it was something like 3.6 it becomes 4. We actually just want to get rid of everything after the decimal place. To do that, the easiest way is to import the math module and then use a function called math .floor and this math.floor, if I hover over it, is going to return the largest whole number that is less than or equal to x. If this was a 4.8, then the largest hole number less than 4.8 is 4. So that's basically what this is going to do. And this is going to give us the number of minutes. Now, the next thing we want to do is to know, well, how many seconds is left after we've taken away the minutes. To do this, we're going to do counts and then we're going to use the modulo to divide it by 60. So the modulo is going to give us the remainder number of seconds after we've cleanly divided it by 600. For example, if we had 100 seconds and we divide that by 60, well, that's going to be equal to one. So we can minus 60 from 100 and we get 40 as the remainder. That is what we will get after doing the modulo. So that's basically the number of seconds that remains. So now that we've got the minute and the second, we can actually change this count to use an f-string and we can format it so that we add the count minute first, and then we add a colon and then we add our count in seconds. Now look at what happens. We're going to try and count down five minutes. So we get hold of the number of seconds, we pass it over to this function, we work out what the count is equivalent to in minutes and seconds and then afterwards we subtract one second each time. So now when I run the code and I hit start, notice how it starts from 5 minutes, goes down to 4 minutes, 50, 59, and then it keeps ongoing like a real timer. That's pretty cool. The only thing left to figure out is how can we get it to not display 5:0? How can we get it to display 5:00 like you would see on a clock? To find out how to do that we have to learn about Python dynamic typing. We have to understand how that works and that is what we're going to be talking about in the next lesson. So I'll see you there. In the last lesson, we managed to get our countdown mechanism to work, and we got it to count down from five minutes to zero. Now, everything works, but there's just something a little bit niggling and you'll see it when I hit start. Notice how it says 5:0. Wouldn't it be so much better if it said 5:00? So how would we do that? Well, that is the zero comes from this count_sec because it's taking the count in seconds, dividing it by 60 and finding the remainder using the modulo. Now, when there is no remainder, it's just going to be equal to zero. So we could use an if statement and check well if the count_sec is equal to zero, then instead of making it zero, let's set it to equal a string which is \"00\". Now this actually, believe it or not, works. And you'll see it when I run it. When I hit start, doesn't that look so much better? But some of you might've realized that there's something a little bit crazy going on here in these two lines of code. We're checking to see if this variable holds data that is equal to the integer, the whole number zero, and then we're setting it to a string. So these are completely two different data types. That's an int and that is a string. So how is it that we're able to do this? So let me pull up the Python console. We know that if we took a integer, say 3, and we try to add it to a string, say a 4, this is not going to work and we get a type error because this is type int and this is type string. So you can't actually add these two together because there's a mismatch. Now here's the crazy thing. Let's create a variable a and let's make it hold the integer with 3. And at this point, you can see that this a variable has a data type of int. If I decide to change that variable and make it hold a different type of data, let's say the number 4, or let's make it simpler, let's make it hold the piece of text, Hello. As soon as that goes through, you can see that a is now of data type string. And the very fact that I'm able to do that, change a variable's data type by changing the content in that variable, this is what's known as dynamic typing. In this sense, Python is a language that's quite unique because on one hand it is strongly typed, in the sense that it holds on to the data type of the variable, so this a is a string and it knows that it's a string and if you do something that is not meant for a string, say if you try to raise a to the power of 2, then that is going to be a type error. Types matter and when you call a function that's expecting a particular type, say if you use the power function which is expecting a integer and you pass in something that's obviously not an integer say, our string here and you try to get it to do some things, say raise it to the power of 3, then again, we get type error. It knows what type is supposed to go into that function and it makes sure that you comply with that. This is where the language is strongly typed. But the part where the language is dynamically typed is that even though it knows what type a variable is, it knows what type a function expects, you can also dynamically change the data type of any variable like this. That is basically what we're using here. We're using dynamic typing to change the data type of count_sec from a integer to a string. And then we use that string to display inside this canvas text. Now there is however, still a bit of a bug with this and you'll see it once it dips below 10 seconds. Notice that as soon as it goes to 9 seconds, instead of saying 09, which is what you would want or 08, 06, it just lists the number of seconds until it reaches 00. So how can we fix this? The key lies in these two lines of code. See if you can do this as a challenge, pause the video and see if you can make it so that when it's nine seconds remaining, it says 09 or 08 or 07 and also 00 of course. Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge. All right. So basically what we want to check for is when the count in seconds is less than 10, because now it's going to be in the single digits and instead of having just one digit, we wanna add a zero in front of it. So the way we can do this is through just an f-string. We can use an f-string to add the zero in front and then add the count in seconds afterwards, formatting that into the standard kind of time format. Now that we fixed that if we run our app again it goes down to 10 seconds you can see it now says 09, 08, 07 and it's nicely formatted using our f-string. And we're able to do because of the flexibility of the data types in Python, checking it as a number, making sure it's less than 10 and then formatting it as a string and using the f-string. Now, this is not a feature that's available in all programming languages. For example, languages like C or Java or Swift, you won't be able to do this. Once you create a variable and you give it a certain type of data, then it must forever hold on to that type of data. But Python allows you to change the data type of a variable just by assigning it to a different type of value. There's a really well-worded Stack Overflow answer that addresses this exact thing I'm talking about, talking about the fact that Python is a strongly dynamically typed language. And I recommend that if you want to dig more into this, to have a read of this answer and I'll link to this in the course resources. Now we're almost there. When we hit start, our countdown works and it starts counting down from however minutes we tell it to. Here's a challenge for you. We know that the Pomodoro technique requires us to work for 25 minutes and then after 25 minutes to take a short break, and then it goes back to 25 and this repeats until we've done four sets of 25 minutes, and then we get a long break. So I want you to have a think about how you could create a variable called reps, which is going to be a global variable, and you can access it inside start_timer by tapping into this global reps. Now using the modulo or some other sort of mechanism that you can think of see if you can figure out how to get our countdown timer to count down a different number of minutes. For example, we would start out with work_seconds which is going to be the work in minutes times 60, and then we have our short_break_sec and our long break seconds. Now, how can we call this countdown timer so that if it's the first third, fifth, seventh, rep that we're actually doing our countdown, then we want this countdown to do our 25 minutes in terms of work seconds. But on the other hand, if it is, um, the eighth rep, then we want the countdown to work on our long break seconds. But if it's the second or fourth or sixth rep then it should count down to our short break seconds. Essentially what we're trying to achieve is for our countdown timer to do 25 minutes, then 5 minutes, then 25, 5, and until we've done four sets of 25, then do we get a 20 minute break. So have a think about what you've done before using the modulo and see if you can figure out how to get this to work in your code. Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge. All right. So what we want to do is first when we start the timer to increase the reps. So we're going to increase it by one. So now it starts out at the first rep or the first repetition. Now on this first repetition, it's going to need to run this particular line of code. And then when it gets to the second repetition, it needs to run this line of code. And finally, when it gets to the eighth repetition then it needs to run this line of code. So we can actually use a if statement to check for all of these things. So here we can check to see if the reps modulo by 8 is equal to zero. If the number of reps divided by 8 has no remainder, then that means it's actually the time for a long break. Now, Elif though, or else if the reps is actually even, so if modulo 2 is equal to zero, then in this case it should be time for a short break. And finally, if it's none of those conditions and we have an else statement, then it's just a normal work time. Now we might think that's all that's required, but as usual we have to test it to be sure. So let's go ahead and change our work minute down to one minute so that we can run it and have a reasonable chance of seeing when it actually finally reaches zero. Once our timer counter goes down to zero, we would expect it to go to a five minute break, but it doesn't. It actually just stops. And this is why we need to test our code and test our programs as frequently as we write code so that we can catch these bugs in terms of our logic. So what's happening here? Well, basically it's counting down to the number of seconds that we told it to count down to. And then once it's done that, well, that's kind of the end. There's no other way of triggering start timer unless we press the button. So what we actually need to do is to add a else statement here and catch when the count goes to zero, because it's in that moment that we want to actually call start timer once again. And this time it's going to increase the reps and figure out which countdown we actually need to go to. So if we run this code again and I fast forward through the timer, you can see that now, once it hits zero, it's going to go straight to our five minute break and it continues the timer. Now, as the user though, it's quite hard to tell whether if I'm in a work section or if I'm in a break section and what's actually going on. So we should improve the user experience by changing this title from saying timer to whatever it is that the user should be doing. So if they are in this long break countdown then it should say break, if they're in a short break section it should say break, and if they're in the work section then it should say work. So the label that we need to change is this title label. And I also want to change the color, the foreground color, so that when it's work, it's green, when its a short break it's pink, when it was a long break it's red. So of course, I'm referring to these constants over here. See if you can complete this as a challenge and get that label to change to display to the user, what they should be doing each time. Pause the video and complete this challenge. Okay. So when they're on a long break, we're going to get our title label to configure it and change the text to say break. And we're also going to configure the foreground color at the same time and we're going to make this the red color. Now for the next one, which is the short break, it's also going to read break, but in this case, the foreground color is going to be pink. And finally, when they should be working, the foreground color is going to be green and the label is going to read work. So now when it's during a work session, it will say work. And when it switches to the break time, then it's going to say break. And because this is pink, this is, of course, the short break where we can also see that we've got five minutes and counting. And when it gets to the long break after four sessions of work, then the text would be red and the countdown would show 20 minutes. We're pretty much almost there. There's just a couple of loose ends to tie off. One is to change this part so that we actually get a checkmark for every successful work session we complete, and also to make sure that our reset button works so that when we click on it, the timer stops and goes back to zero. So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson. Now we're at the final stretch. Our Pomodoro program is almost complete. We've got this beautiful user interface, we've got beautiful colors from our colorhunt.io color palette, and we've got pretty much everything functioning other than just some loose ends. So the first thing I want to fix is the section with the check marks. So we've created the checkmarks which is a label that currently just contains a single checkmark. Now I'm actually going to cut this checkmark and delete the text here because I want that label to start out as empty. Now, the only time when I want that label to get an extra check mark is when the user has completed a work countdown. So once they've completed their 25 minute session, then they should get that checkmark. To do that I'm going to write the code inside this else statement because every single time a countdown completes, it's going to go into this else statement because the count goes down to zero. Now, currently we're just getting the timer to restart itself and go to the next session. But what we want to do here is we want to check to see how many reps we have, and for every two reps then that means we've completed one work session because it's work then rest, then work, then rest. So for every two reps, we've completed one 25 minute work session. So here's a challenge for you. So have a think about how you can use our variable reps to check so that for every two reps we've completed, we add a checkmark to this checkmark label. Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge, then test it out and see if you managed to get it right. Okay. All right. So we know that the reps is equal to the number of sessions we've had. So for example, if we've done for reps, then that means we've had two work sessions and two breaks. That means we can basically divide reps by two to get the total number of work sessions we've done. What I can do is I can create a temporary variable called mark, which is just going to be in an empty string to start off. And then I can create a for loop to loop through a range. And the range is going to go from zero up to our reps divided by 2. Now this is giving us a warning at the moment because reps divided by 2 or anything divided by anything becomes a floating type number. In our case we want to do is we want to use that math.floor again so that we can floor this reps divided by 2 to a whole number and that way we get the correct number of work sessions. If you want to make this a little bit more clear the next time you read your code, you can actually create a work_sessions and we can move this part of our code over to here. So the total number of work sessions is equal to the reps divided by 2 and then rounded down to the nearest integer. And then we can use that number of work sessions to create our range. When we've created our range, we know that this loop is going to run for that many times. So we can add to our mark. For every single time the loop runs, I'm going to paste in a checkmark. You should have that checkmark that you had from a previously, and you can paste it into here. Now, once we've completed that loop, then all we need to do is the update our checkmarks label by calling config and then changing the text to equal our mark. Now, in this case, it probably makes sense for that to actually be plural. So I'm gonna use my refactor -> rename to just add an 's' to everywhere I'm using this. Now let's test it out. When I hit start, it should start counting down. And once that work session completes, then you'll see the timer go to zero and our first checkmark show up. And for every work session we complete, we get an extra checkmark just to nudge us towards working a little bit harder. The final thing that I want to address is our reset mechanism. So we have this lovely reset button, but it's not really doing anything at the moment. What I'm going to do is create a new function here which I'll call reset_timer. And what this reset_timer is going to do is basically it's going to reset all the checkmarks, reset the text inside the timer, stop the timer and change this title back to the text that it originally had, which is just the word timer. Now, the hardest part about this is actually stopping the timer because what we have to do is we actually need to tap into that window.after again. But instead of calling after, we actually want to call after_cancel. This way we can actually cancel the timer that we had set up previously. This is the thing that we want to cancel. And if we want to cancel it, we have to give it a name and we have to put it inside a variable. So I'm going to call this my timer. But because this is going to be a local variable because it's created inside this particular function, I actually have to bring it out. I have to make it a global variable, so after create it up here, but what value do I give it? Well, initially, it's actually not going to have any value at all. So it's going to start out as none. And then later on, I'm going to tap into that global timer in order to get it to hold on to this. Now, then once I want to reset my timer and cancel it, well then I can actually tap into this global timer and stop the timer. So now to actually activate this function, reset_timer, we have to add it as a command to our reset button. So where we create our button, I'm gonna add it as a command. And remember, we have to get rid of the parentheses. So now if I run my program and I start my timer, you can see that as soon as I click this reset button, it stops my timer and it doesn't continue. So now all we have to do is the add all of the things that we have to reset, for example, the text in here, we want that to read 00. So that was the timer_text from our canvas. And then the other thing we want to do is the title label. We want to set that to just read timer. And finally, we want to reset our check marks so that once you hit the reset button, it resets this title label, the timer text here stops the timer and gets rid of all the checkmarks, like this. Pause the video and give that a go. Alright. So the first thing we want to change is our timer text. And because the timer text is created in the canvas, we have a slightly different way of changing that. So we call canvas.itemconfig, and then pass in the thing that we want to change, which is the timer text. And then the attribute that we want to change, which is it's text. And then we change that to just say 00:00, go back to the beginning. Now the title label is a lot easier to change. We can say title_label.config, and then we can configure its text to basically just read timer. Finally, we're going to reset our checkmarks. So we tap into our checkmarks' label again, using config to change the text back to empty. However, there's still a slight problem with our code. What happens if while our timer is counting down I hit the reset button and then hit the start button again? Did you spot that? Our timer jumped from \"Work\" to \"Break\" because our reps are still increasing. So far we haven't reset the number of reps to zero when we reset the timer. So all we need to do to fix this bug is add:",

      "while these labels are in column 0. But that's fine. It's gonna even out once we add the other components. That's all the labels done. The next thing are the entries. Now, as I showed you in the slide, these entries will have different widths. So the website entry, this one here, and the email entry are both going to have a width of 35. While the password entry is only going to have a width of 21. Now remember that the width is a property of the entry class. It's not something that's related to the grid. So if inside this grid method, you add something like width, then this is not going to work and it's going to give you an error. So that's a common source of error for students so be aware. Once we've created our entries, it's time to lay them out using our grid. Now, the first website entry is going to go into the same row as the website label, so that row 1, but the column is going to be column 1 so it's the next one over. Okay. And the email entry is going to be in exactly the same column, but just shifted one row down. And finally the password entry is going to be on the next row, so row 3, and it's going to be in column 1  as well. Right now, this is what it looks like. And you can see that this doesn't look terribly bad other than maybe I need to change this to a capital P and I could probably add a colon to the end of each of these lines, like this. Now the final step to do is to add the two buttons. So one button has to go over here to the right of the password field and one has to go at the bottom. Okay. Now, this generate password button is going to be on the grid but it's going to be in the third column. And in terms of row, it's going to be on the same row as the password, which is row 3. Okay. While the add button is simply going to be in the last row, right? And this should be a button rather than a radio button. So this is what we have so far. This is clearly not what we wanted to have, which looks more like this. And if I put it side by side, you can see that the add button is far too small. Referring back to this, we need to set the width to 36. So let's go ahead and add that. Okay. Now, that makes the button a lot wider, but it still doesn't solve the fact that this generate password is actually in a completely different column while we actually ideally want that button to cover the entire password entry and also the generate password. So we need this button basically to have a column span of 2 so that it spans both of these columns. And in fact, so does the website entry and the email/username entry. So let's fix that. The website entry grid is going to have a additional keyword argument which is the column span, and this is going to be set to 2. And we're gonna add that to the email entry when it's on the grid as well, and finally the add button. So now you can see that we're getting pretty close, right? Once we put in those columnspans, you can see our layout has dramatically changed and everything now looks a lot more aligned. Now the alignment is not perfect because the generate password button is actually just allowed to be the size that it needs to be. And I've tinkered around with some of the widths and you can, of course, try out your own widths and nudge it around a bit to see if you can change it. But I think in terms of overall look, this is not bad. The only thing I would add is maybe our padding of 20 around the side of the window is actually not enough. Maybe we need to increase it a little bit. If you want to, you can actually change the padding to 50 so that you get a little bit more white space and it looks a little bit less busy. So this is the final design that we're trying to get to. And now that we've set up all of our UI, all that's left to do is to add the functionality. And that is what we're going to do in coming lessons. So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson. Now that the UI is all set up, it's time to go onto the next step where we actually can start saving some of this data that the user is entering. So that there's a couple of things I want to show you before we get started. Firstly, notice how when we run our code at the moment, it just launches our app. But wouldn't it be nice if the cursor was already within the first textbox? That means the user can start typing straight away when they launched the password manager. To do that, you can of course dig through the docs, but the easiest way is to get hold of that website entry and then call a method on it called a focus. And this will focus the cursor into that particular entry. And you can see that right there. Now the next thing that would be nice is when you're signing up for lots of websites, at least in my case, I often use just one email to sign up. So wouldn't it be nice if when we launch our password manager that this email field is already pre-populated with our most commonly used email? Well, we can do that by simply adding a starting value to that email entry. And the way that we do that is through a method called insert. Now insert it takes two parameters. And in fact, you can actually scroll down to the insert method and you can see it describes in detail that it takes an index and also the string that you want to insert. The way that the index works is it's basically where the cursor is. If you wanted to insert it at the very beginning of that email entry, then you could just put in zero. That basically inserts this piece of text at the first zeroth character. Alternatively, there's another useful index which is called end. And this end comes from tkinter constants and its just a constant that's gonna represent the very last character that's inside that entry. For example, if inside your entry you already had some text and you want to insert it after your text here, then you would use the index as end. But if you want to insert it at the very beginning, then you would use the index as zero. Now in our case, it shouldn't actually matter because our email entry will start out being completely empty. So I'm going to choose to insert this piece of text at the very beginning and the text that I'm going to insert is just a example dummy email. This is not my real email, but in your case, if you were creating your own password manager, then you could put down your own email so that every time you run the app, it already starts out being pre-populated when that email that you've got. So now the rest of the challenge is pretty much going to be up to you. Inside this save password section, what I want you to do is to be able to take the inputs that are put into the website entry, the email entry and the password entry, and when the user clicks on this add button, I want you to somehow figure out how to save that data into a file called data .txt. This data.txt is going to take the website that the user entered, the email that they entered and the password that they entered and it's going to put it in here with a space in between and a pipe symbol that you can find on your keyboard. Or in fact, you can format this however you like because at the end of the day, you're going to be the one looking at this file to find your emails and passwords. So format it in a way that's comfortable for you. But essentially, what we want to do is to transport things that the user types into here, the website that this password is for, their email and their password and the moment that they press this add button to trigger some sort of function that saves this information into a data.txt file. And that format is the information like this. And every time the user adds another entry, it's going to be added on a new line and it's going to be appended to the end of the previous entry. So I know that it's been a little while since we last dealt with writing to file. So I'll link to the documentation that's relevant to this challenge. One is how to write to file using Python and you can see the demo code which you can run and you can try out, and then you're going to format that to work for your particular case. Now, the other thing is the tkinter entry widget. So there is the insert method that's going to be pretty useful. But the other thing that you want to happen is once you press the add button, you want all of this information other than the email to be cleared out. So you're probably also going to have to take a look at the delete function. And at the very top, you can see it even shows you how to delete something entirely from an entry. Using these two pieces of documentation. I want you to be able to take this information, put it into a data.txt file and afterward, wipe clear this website entry and the password entry. So that's all there is to it. There's going to be quite a bit of code writing. So you have a think about it and go ahead and complete this challenge. I'll wait for you and we'll go through the solution afterward together. So the first thing I need to happen is when the user presses on the add button, I need to trigger a function. So in this add_button, I'm also going to add a command and I'm going to call my function save. So I'm going to put that function inside the section save password. Now this save function is going to write to a file which is called data.txt, or in fact, you can call it anything you want. Inside the save function we want to be able to write to a particular file. So we need to open the file and then we need to write to it. And we can use the option a, to append to the end of the file. Or write, which overrides any existing content or read, which just reads the actual file. Now in our case, every time we add a new password, we wanna add it to the previous passwords. So we're going to need this append. So let's go ahead and open a file which we're going to call data.txt and we're going to open it using the append mode. Now, remember that when you're opening a file using the append mode or the write mode, and that file doesn't exist, it's simply going to create it. We are gonna open this and you can either save it to a file name, so you could do it like this data_file = open, or you might have remembered that previously we spoke about the with keyword. So we can say with open this particular data file as our data file. And what this allows us to do is it will close this file automatically without us having to later write file.close. So it's a much better way of working with files. But if you didn't remember the with keyword, don't worry. Using the open will still work. Now, once we've opened our data.txt in append mode, the next step is to actually add the pieces of data. Now, how do we get hold of data from our entries? Well, that's where the entry documentation comes in handy. And you can see even at the very top, it tells you that to fetch the current entry text, use the get method, so the entry.get. We can get hold of our website by getting hold of the website entry and then calling .get. And then we can do the same for email and password. Once we've gotten all of these pieces of text, then we're going to be writing it into our file. So our data_file.write and what we're going to write is a string which I'm going to format using an f-string. And I'm first going to put in the website and then space and pipe symbol, space and then it's going to be the email and finally, it's going to be the password. Let's check this out, let's run it and see if it works right? Say we're signing up for Amazon, I'm going to use my normal username and I'm going to create a password which is super insecure, which you should never use. But now I'm going to click on add. And after I've clicked it, even though nothing has happened so far, if we take a look inside our project folder, you can see we've now magically created this data.txt file. And you can see it's formatted our website, email, and password, all into that file. So that's pretty much a success. Now, the other thing I mentioned is that it would be nice to get some sort of indication that it worked right? And for our application to be prepped and ready for the next piece of data to be entered. So we wanted to delete whatever text there's inside the website entry and the password entry. If you take a look again at the documentation, you can see that you can delete whatever is inside the entry by calling delete and telling it to delete from a particular index to another index. Now, there's more detailed if you actually scroll down to the actual method and it tells you that it takes two parameters; first and last. First is the start of the range and last is the end of the range. And it tells you that if you omit it, it's only going to remove one character. So that's not what we want. We want it to remove all of the characters in a particular entry. So let's start out with our website entry, call delete on it, and we're going to start from index zero and go all the way to the end. In the same way that we used our index when we inserted our email to the email entry, we moved the cursor to the very start, the zeroth character in that entry. In this case, we're deleting from the zeroth character to the end of the entry. And then we can do the same for our password entry, right? And now if we run this code, you can see that once I type something in and let's just generate another bad password Qwerty. And by the way, if I've called out any of your passwords, just for my sake, um, and definitely for your own security, go ahead and change it. These are really bad passwords. But either way, I'm going to click add and you can see the moment that I've clicked that my website and my password entries have now cleared out and it's now ready to take the next entry. And back in my data.txt, I've now got another entry. But notice this, it's been added to the end of the previous entry, but its on the same line. That's a little bit confusing. Now you might remember this special character which is \\n, and that allows us to enter things onto a new line. Let's delete everything that we've got in here so far and let's hit save so that we can start from scratch. Now let's run our program with that new line inserted. And if I go ahead and add the website and let me think of another bad password, um, password is a really terrible password. Now, if I click add, you'll notice that those fields disappear and that the password gets added into here. Now, if I try and add another value in here, so let's say-- then you can see that the next value got added in on the next line, which is a lot better in terms of formatting. These are just small things that make things look tidy and neat. But the big part was remembering how to save things into a file and using the documentation to get hold of the values inside our entries and putting it into our data file. One of the things you might have realized is that it's a terrible user experience when the user enters a piece of data, say a website and a password and they click add. Things sort of disappear, but they don't really have a confirmation that this, in fact, did work. So in the next lesson, we're going to look at how we can create some popups so that we can show the user what the result was of their action. We can tell them if it was successful or if it was not, ask them to confirm whether if they're happy with that data entry. So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson. Now in the last lesson, we managed to get our password manager to start saving the data that we're entering inside the password manager. And we formatted it and put it inside our data.txt. Now, one of the things that was a bit of an issue in terms of user experience is whenever the user actually enters their details into this password manager at the moment, it doesn't actually give you some sort of way of knowing that it was successful or if it was not, or actually getting them to check and verify that the data that they've entered is definitely the one that they want to save into the file. In order to do this, we're going to learn about something else that you can do with tkinter which is something called standard dialogs. These are basically popups that your tkinter program can generate. And one of the most popular standard dialogs are the message boxes. And it's really, really easy to create these popups. You can simply just import the message box module and you can tap into methods like show info or show warning, show error, or you can ask the user yes no, or OK or cancel, ask a question yes or no, ask to retry or cancel. Now the screenshots where made in a Swedish version of Windows, but we can actually try these out ourselves and start putting in some standard dialogs so that we can give the user some feedback. The thing that we really want to tell the user is the moment that the save function is called it's because they pressed on the add button here. But before we actually commit all of the current information to the file, we want to check and make sure that they're actually happy with what they've written. So we can create a message box here and get them to check the details that they've entered and then hit yes or no as to whether if they want to save it. In order to use the message box, we actually have to import the message box. Again, it's from the tkinter module that we're going to import the message box module. Now notice how this is not actually a class. So that's why, even though we've said * which means import everything, it actually only imports all of the classes, the constants, but it doesn't import things like the message box, which is simply just another module of code. And in fact, if you right-click on it and go to implementation here, then you can actually see this messagebox.py file and how it's implemented. The thing that's important though is to actually put it into use. So we can use the message box and call a method to show a popup. The simplest type is just showinfo which you only need to think about two things really; a title and also a message. So I'm just going to put title as title and message as message. And you can see when I press add, I get this up and it's just got the title and the message and you can't do anything other than click OK. In addition to showinfo, there is actually a lot of other methods; you can ask yes or no, ask retry or cancel. You can show an error or you can show a warning. Now in addition, you can actually ask the user something. So this generates two buttons, yes or no, retry or cancel, OK or cancel, ask question is also yes and no, and we've also got yes, no and cancel here. What I'm going to do is I'm going to ask OK or cancel. And what I want to ask the user is I'm going to set the title as the website that they've entered so that's going to come from here, and then I'm going to set the message as a f-string. So I'm going to say these are the details entered:",
      "row= 2",
      "for item in ",
      "column=0",
      "if I wanted to create an account on App Brewery, then I enter the name of the website so that I know what this password is for, I put in my email, and username is already prepopulated in my password manager. And then all I have to do is to either come up with a password that is hopefully not terrible, but I can obviously never remember, or I can use the builtin generate password to just generate me a very complex, very long password with all of the required numbers and symbols and all of that. And once I'm done with that, then I can click add, and I get a popup asking me if this is okay. And if that all looks good, then I click Yes and that data gets added to a text file, which I have on my computer. So this is not an internet-based service and you keep everything locally on your computer, which some people feel is a lot safer than using a third-party service like LastPass or whatever else. So this is what we're trying to build and it's got some really neat features. For example, it's got some basic validations. So if you, for example, leave one of the fields empty and you click add, you get a popup that tells you, please don't leave any of the fields empty. Or if you generate a password, then you can actually immediately use it by pasting it. What's happening behind the scenes is as soon as I click on generate password, then my password is saved onto my clipboard and I can paste it into the password field on the website I'm trying to sign up for. This is what we're going to be building today. And it's going to use everything you've learned about tkinter and we're going to be learning some new things that you can do with tkinter as well. Once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and let's get started. To begin, as always, head over to the course resources and download the starting project as a zip file. Now, once you've unzipped it, open it using PyCharm and go ahead and take a look inside the starting files. I've included a logo image which is going to be used in our project. And I've got also a very, very blank looking at main.py. Now here comes a challenge already. To start out, we're going to create a window using tkinter that has a title of Password Manager. And the only thing that it's going to have is just a canvas widget displaying that logo image. So the canvas is going to have a width and height of 200 pixels, and the canvas is going to be padded from the edge of the window by 20 pixels on all four sides so that way it could look quite centered like this. And this image finally is going to be bang in the center of the canvas. So I want you to think back to what you learned yesterday about the canvas widget and in the course resources, I've linked to this page on the canvas documentation including that all important create_image method. Have a look through this for what the expected inputs are and you can also scroll up to see more of the references on other things that you can do with the canvas. Or just have a quick look through yesterday's code if you need to. But I want you to be able to create a tkinter program using all the things that you've learned and when you run it, it should look pretty much the same as this. Pause the video and complete this challenge, Okay. So to begin, we're going to go to the very top of our file, and I'm going to import all of the classes inside tkinter and I'm going to use that to do my UI setup. As always, I start out creating a window and then give it a title. And then I'm going to get my window to start out with my main loop. Now in between, I'm going to create my canvas. And this is from the canvas widget. Now this canvas widget, as I mentioned, is going to have a height of 200 and a width of 200. And in addition, it's going to display this logo.png inside as the image. So I'm going to create our logo image from the photo image class, and then I have to provide the filename. So the filename is just simply logo.png in this case because they're both inside the same folder. So once I've created my image, I can tell my canvas to create a image inside the canvas and then I can specify the image name and that is of course going to be my logo image. Now, the other thing that I have to do before I can actually run my code, because at the moment it's actually going to give me an error and the error says tuple index out of range. It's basically expecting some sort of a tuple to work on and that tuple is the define what the X and Y position is of this image on the canvas. So we do that by simply just adding the raw numbers. So the X position of the center of the image is going to be 100, because remember that the width is 200 so half of that is 100. And similarly for the Y position, it's also going to be 100. So this way we've got the X and Y position to find, and we've created the canvas size. Now, all we need to do is to get our canvas to have some sort of layout dimension. I'm just going to start out by packing my canvas onto the screen because later on, once we have more components, then we can think about using more fancy things like the grid. Now, if I run this as it is, then you can see that I've created my password manager window and I've created my 200 by 200 canvas. The only requirement I haven't yet satisfied is adding some padding between the window and that canvas. So let's do that using our window.config, and I'm going to set the padding using the padx and pady. And as we mentioned, I'm going to set that to 20 on the X and 20 on the Y. So now we get pretty much exactly the image that you saw in the demonstration, and this is the end result we were looking for. Did you manage to complete this challenge? If not, be sure to review some of the lessons that we learned yesterday where we went through the canvas widget in great detail. But if you're happy with all of this code, then in the next lesson, we're going to be learning more about the grid system and how to lay out a complex user interface like this one. So for all of that and more, I'll see you there. To go from this, to this will require not only some widgets to be added but a little bit more knowledge about how to lay out our widgets on the grid. Because notice how here we've got a single entry that is spread across the right side of the screen, but then down here we've got an entry that's only taking up a part of that space. Effectively, if we think about our grid, this particular entry is actually taking up two columns. So how can we do this? To demonstrate this, I've created a sandbox app. So it's super simple, all it has is a red label and a green label. And you can see that the red label has a width of 20, and a height of 5, as does the green, but the red is on row=0, column=0, whereas the green is on row=1, column=1. So we get this kind of checkered kind of look. If I decide to go and add another label, let's call it 'b' for blue, and I give it a background of blue, and then I give it the same width and height. Now if I put this new label onto the grid and I put it on to the next row, so row= 2, but the column I'm going to put it on column=0. Now, I think at this point you can probably all predict where that label is going to go. And indeed it goes on to the very first leftmost column and it's on the third row. Now, what if I wanted that blue label to go across the entire width so that it's below the red and also below the green. Well, you might think that I could simply just double the width, right? Instead of a width of 20, let's change it to 40. Surely, that's going to stretch this label so that it goes across the entire red and green label. But unfortunately, when I run this, you'll see, instead, this happens. The blue label is still within the first column, and in fact, it's stretched that column to a 40 width, and that red column is now centered again in the leftmost or the first column, and that blue is nowhere near the green label, because it's not allowed to go into that second column. So how can we solve this situation? Well, the actual answer is another attribute that the grid has, which is something called a columnspan . Now the columnspan is exactly what it sounds like, really, it's basically how many columns is this particular thing going to span. So in our case, we want it to go across two columns column 0 and column 1. So it should start out at column 0 but then span a whole 2 columns, and now when I run this code you can see we get our desired effect. The blue label is now across the red and the green and it's spanning two columns. The link to this playground is in the Course Resources, so feel free to head over there and give it a go if you want to play around with this example. Now, in our case, if we break down the final layout we're looking for, it's effectively a three-column, and five-row layout. So we've already got our canvas which is actually going to go in the middle, so probably the second column. And then we've got the Website, the Email/Username, the Password, and finally our two Buttons. Now I've laid out this entire user interface, and I've specified the width of some of these entries and buttons, just because you'll need to do a bit of tweaking around just to make sure that everything lines up with each other. I've already done that ahead of time, and I've really worked out the sort of near optimal width. So what I want you to do is to use what we've learned about the Grid Columnspan, so if we have our Label, our Button, New Button, and Entry, if I want this particular button to go across two columns, then I have to change that columnspan attribute to 2. And I have to specify which column it starts out in and how many columns it's going to go across. Using everything you've learned so far, I want you to recreate this user interface. Have a look at what's on screen, these are labels, these are entries, and these two are buttons. Have a look at where they lie within the grid system, and how many columns they go across, and also the width of some of these widgets, and see if you can recreate this user interface in your project. So pause the video and give that a go. Did you have a go at the challenge? Here's what we currently have, and this is what you should have created upon completing the challenge. If you haven't had a go at attempting to recreate this user interface, pause the video now because I'm about to walk you through the solution. Again, we're going to be within the UI setup section, and I'm going to write my code below where I've got my canvas. Now, the first thing I'm going to create are actually all of these labels because they're relatively simple to layout and they'll be a quick and easy job. Okay. Now I've created three labels and it's time to actually put them onto the screen. Now, because I'm going to be using grids I can't use pack in addition. So I also have to put my canvas onto the grid. The canvas is going to go onto the grid in row 0, the first row at the very top. And in terms of column it's actually going to be column 1, the middle column. And then going down the list, my website label and my email label and my password label, they're all going to be on subsequent rows. So row 1 and then row 2 and row 3. And they're all going to be in the same column, which is going to be column 0, the very first column. Now, if I run this code and we take a look, you can see that it looks a little bit weird just because this canvas is in column 1 while these labels are in column 0. But that's fine. It's gonna even out once we add the other components. That's all the labels done. The next thing are the entries. Now, as I showed you in the slide, these entries will have different widths. So the website entry, this one here, and the email entry are both going to have a width of 35. While the password entry is only going to have a width of 21. Now remember that the width is a property of the entry class. It's not something that's related to the grid. So if inside this grid method, you add something like width, then this is not going to work and it's going to give you an error. So that's a common source of error for students so be aware. Once we've created our entries, it's time to lay them out using our grid. Now, the first website entry is going to go into the same row as the website label, so that row 1, but the column is going to be column 1 so it's the next one over. Okay. And the email entry is going to be in exactly the same column, but just shifted one row down. And finally the password entry is going to be on the next row, so row 3, and it's going to be in column 1  as well. Right now, this is what it looks like. And you can see that this doesn't look terribly bad other than maybe I need to change this to a capital P and I could probably add a colon to the end of each of these lines, like this. Now the final step to do is to add the two buttons. So one button has to go over here to the right of the password field and one has to go at the bottom. Okay. Now, this generate password button is going to be on the grid but it's going to be in the third column. And in terms of row, it's going to be on the same row as the password, which is row 3. Okay. While the add button is simply going to be in the last row, right? And this should be a button rather than a radio button. So this is what we have so far. This is clearly not what we wanted to have, which looks more like this. And if I put it side by side, you can see that the add button is far too small. Referring back to this, we need to set the width to 36. So let's go ahead and add that. Okay. Now, that makes the button a lot wider, but it still doesn't solve the fact that this generate password is actually in a completely different column while we actually ideally want that button to cover the entire password entry and also the generate password. So we need this button basically to have a column span of 2 so that it spans both of these columns. And in fact, so does the website entry and the email/username entry. So let's fix that. The website entry grid is going to have a additional keyword argument which is the column span, and this is going to be set to 2. And we're gonna add that to the email entry when it's on the grid as well, and finally the add button. So now you can see that we're getting pretty close, right? Once we put in those columnspans, you can see our layout has dramatically changed and everything now looks a lot more aligned. Now the alignment is not perfect because the generate password button is actually just allowed to be the size that it needs to be. And I've tinkered around with some of the widths and you can, of course, try out your own widths and nudge it around a bit to see if you can change it. But I think in terms of overall look, this is not bad. The only thing I would add is maybe our padding of 20 around the side of the window is actually not enough. Maybe we need to increase it a little bit. If you want to, you can actually change the padding to 50 so that you get a little bit more white space and it looks a little bit less busy. So this is the final design that we're trying to get to. And now that we've set up all of our UI, all that's left to do is to add the functionality. And that is what we're going to do in coming lessons. So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson. Now that the UI is all set up, it's time to go onto the next step where we actually can start saving some of this data that the user is entering. So that there's a couple of things I want to show you before we get started. Firstly, notice how when we run our code at the moment, it just launches our app. But wouldn't it be nice if the cursor was already within the first textbox? That means the user can start typing straight away when they launched the password manager. To do that, you can of course dig through the docs, but the easiest way is to get hold of that website entry and then call a method on it called a focus. And this will focus the cursor into that particular entry. And you can see that right there. Now the next thing that would be nice is when you're signing up for lots of websites, at least in my case, I often use just one email to sign up. So wouldn't it be nice if when we launch our password manager that this email field is already pre-populated with our most commonly used email? Well, we can do that by simply adding a starting value to that email entry. And the way that we do that is through a method called insert. Now insert it takes two parameters. And in fact, you can actually scroll down to the insert method and you can see it describes in detail that it takes an index and also the string that you want to insert. The way that the index works is it's basically where the cursor is. If you wanted to insert it at the very beginning of that email entry, then you could just put in zero. That basically inserts this piece of text at the first zeroth character. Alternatively, there's another useful index which is called end. And this end comes from tkinter constants and its just a constant that's gonna represent the very last character that's inside that entry. For example, if inside your entry you already had some text and you want to insert it after your text here, then you would use the index as end. But if you want to insert it at the very beginning, then you would use the index as zero. Now in our case, it shouldn't actually matter because our email entry will start out being completely empty. So I'm going to choose to insert this piece of text at the very beginning and the text that I'm going to insert is just a example dummy email. This is not my real email, but in your case, if you were creating your own password manager, then you could put down your own email so that every time you run the app, it already starts out being pre-populated when that email that you've got. So now the rest of the challenge is pretty much going to be up to you. Inside this save password section, what I want you to do is to be able to take the inputs that are put into the website entry, the email entry and the password entry, and when the user clicks on this add button, I want you to somehow figure out how to save that data into a file called data .txt. This data.txt is going to take the website that the user entered, the email that they entered and the password that they entered and it's going to put it in here with a space in between and a pipe symbol that you can find on your keyboard. Or in fact, you can format this however you like because at the end of the day, you're going to be the one looking at this file to find your emails and passwords. So format it in a way that's comfortable for you. But essentially, what we want to do is to transport things that the user types into here, the website that this password is for, their email and their password and the moment that they press this add button to trigger some sort of function that saves this information into a data.txt file. And that format is the information like this. And every time the user adds another entry, it's going to be added on a new line and it's going to be appended to the end of the previous entry. So I know that it's been a little while since we last dealt with writing to file. So I'll link to the documentation that's relevant to this challenge. One is how to write to file using Python and you can see the demo code which you can run and you can try out, and then you're going to format that to work for your particular case. Now, the other thing is the tkinter entry widget. So there is the insert method that's going to be pretty useful. But the other thing that you want to happen is once you press the add button, you want all of this information other than the email to be cleared out. So you're probably also going to have to take a look at the delete function. And at the very top, you can see it even shows you how to delete something entirely from an entry. Using these two pieces of documentation. I want you to be able to take this information, put it into a data.txt file and afterward, wipe clear this website entry and the password entry. So that's all there is to it. There's going to be quite a bit of code writing. So you have a think about it and go ahead and complete this challenge. I'll wait for you and we'll go through the solution afterward together. So the first thing I need to happen is when the user presses on the add button, I need to trigger a function. So in this add_button, I'm also going to add a command and I'm going to call my function save. So I'm going to put that function inside the section save password. Now this save function is going to write to a file which is called data.txt, or in fact, you can call it anything you want. Inside the save function we want to be able to write to a particular file. So we need to open the file and then we need to write to it. And we can use the option a, to append to the end of the file. Or write, which overrides any existing content or read, which just reads the actual file. Now in our case, every time we add a new password, we wanna add it to the previous passwords. So we're going to need this append. So let's go ahead and open a file which we're going to call data.txt and we're going to open it using the append mode. Now, remember that when you're opening a file using the append mode or the write mode, and that file doesn't exist, it's simply going to create it. We are gonna open this and you can either save it to a file name, so you could do it like this data_file = open, or you might have remembered that previously we spoke about the with keyword. So we can say with open this particular data file as our data file. And what this allows us to do is it will close this file automatically without us having to later write file.close. So it's a much better way of working with files. But if you didn't remember the with keyword, don't worry. Using the open will still work. Now, once we've opened our data.txt in append mode, the next step is to actually add the pieces of data. Now, how do we get hold of data from our entries? Well, that's where the entry documentation comes in handy. And you can see even at the very top, it tells you that to fetch the current entry text, use the get method, so the entry.get. We can get hold of our website by getting hold of the website entry and then calling .get. And then we can do the same for email and password. Once we've gotten all of these pieces of text, then we're going to be writing it into our file. So our data_file.write and what we're going to write is a string which I'm going to format using an f-string. And I'm first going to put in the website and then space and pipe symbol, space and then it's going to be the email and finally, it's going to be the password. Let's check this out, let's run it and see if it works right? Say we're signing up for Amazon, I'm going to use my normal username and I'm going to create a password which is super insecure, which you should never use. But now I'm going to click on add. And after I've clicked it, even though nothing has happened so far, if we take a look inside our project folder, you can see we've now magically created this data.txt file. And you can see it's formatted our website, email, and password, all into that file. So that's pretty much a success. Now, the other thing I mentioned is that it would be nice to get some sort of indication that it worked right? And for our application to be prepped and ready for the next piece of data to be entered. So we wanted to delete whatever text there's inside the website entry and the password entry. If you take a look again at the documentation, you can see that you can delete whatever is inside the entry by calling delete and telling it to delete from a particular index to another index. Now, there's more detailed if you actually scroll down to the actual method and it tells you that it takes two parameters; first and last. First is the start of the range and last is the end of the range. And it tells you that if you omit it, it's only going to remove one character. So that's not what we want. We want it to remove all of the characters in a particular entry. So let's start out with our website entry, call delete on it, and we're going to start from index zero and go all the way to the end. In the same way that we used our index when we inserted our email to the email entry, we moved the cursor to the very start, the zeroth character in that entry. In this case, we're deleting from the zeroth character to the end of the entry. And then we can do the same for our password entry, right? And now if we run this code, you can see that once I type something in and let's just generate another bad password Qwerty. And by the way, if I've called out any of your passwords, just for my sake, um, and definitely for your own security, go ahead and change it. These are really bad passwords. But either way, I'm going to click add and you can see the moment that I've clicked that my website and my password entries have now cleared out and it's now ready to take the next entry. And back in my data.txt, I've now got another entry. But notice this, it's been added to the end of the previous entry, but its on the same line. That's a little bit confusing. Now you might remember this special character which is \\n, and that allows us to enter things onto a new line. Let's delete everything that we've got in here so far and let's hit save so that we can start from scratch. Now let's run our program with that new line inserted. And if I go ahead and add the website and let me think of another bad password, um, password is a really terrible password. Now, if I click add, you'll notice that those fields disappear and that the password gets added into here. Now, if I try and add another value in here, so let's say-- then you can see that the next value got added in on the next line, which is a lot better in terms of formatting. These are just small things that make things look tidy and neat. But the big part was remembering how to save things into a file and using the documentation to get hold of the values inside our entries and putting it into our data file. One of the things you might have realized is that it's a terrible user experience when the user enters a piece of data, say a website and a password and they click add. Things sort of disappear, but they don't really have a confirmation that this, in fact, did work. So in the next lesson, we're going to look at how we can create some popups so that we can show the user what the result was of their action. We can tell them if it was successful or if it was not, ask them to confirm whether if they're happy with that data entry. So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson. Now in the last lesson, we managed to get our password manager to start saving the data that we're entering inside the password manager. And we formatted it and put it inside our data.txt. Now, one of the things that was a bit of an issue in terms of user experience is whenever the user actually enters their details into this password manager at the moment, it doesn't actually give you some sort of way of knowing that it was successful or if it was not, or actually getting them to check and verify that the data that they've entered is definitely the one that they want to save into the file. In order to do this, we're going to learn about something else that you can do with tkinter which is something called standard dialogs. These are basically popups that your tkinter program can generate. And one of the most popular standard dialogs are the message boxes. And it's really, really easy to create these popups. You can simply just import the message box module and you can tap into methods like show info or show warning, show error, or you can ask the user yes no, or OK or cancel, ask a question yes or no, ask to retry or cancel. Now the screenshots where made in a Swedish version of Windows, but we can actually try these out ourselves and start putting in some standard dialogs so that we can give the user some feedback. The thing that we really want to tell the user is the moment that the save function is called it's because they pressed on the add button here. But before we actually commit all of the current information to the file, we want to check and make sure that they're actually happy with what they've written. So we can create a message box here and get them to check the details that they've entered and then hit yes or no as to whether if they want to save it. In order to use the message box, we actually have to import the message box. Again, it's from the tkinter module that we're going to import the message box module. Now notice how this is not actually a class. So that's why, even though we've said * which means import everything, it actually only imports all of the classes, the constants, but it doesn't import things like the message box, which is simply just another module of code. And in fact, if you right-click on it and go to implementation here, then you can actually see this messagebox.py file and how it's implemented. The thing that's important though is to actually put it into use. So we can use the message box and call a method to show a popup. The simplest type is just showinfo which you only need to think about two things really; a title and also a message. So I'm just going to put title as title and message as message. And you can see when I press add, I get this up and it's just got the title and the message and you can't do anything other than click OK. In addition to showinfo, there is actually a lot of other methods; you can ask yes or no, ask retry or cancel. You can show an error or you can show a warning. Now in addition, you can actually ask the user something. So this generates two buttons, yes or no, retry or cancel, OK or cancel, ask question is also yes and no, and we've also got yes, no and cancel here. What I'm going to do is I'm going to ask OK or cancel. And what I want to ask the user is I'm going to set the title as the website that they've entered so that's going to come from here, and then I'm going to set the message as a f-string. So I'm going to say these are the details entered:"

To change the color of the text in a canvas element, use the <code>fill</code> parameter. e.g. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41030973/how-can-i-change-the-color-of-text-in-tkinter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41030973/how-can-i-change-the-color-of-text-in-tkinter</a></p><p>3.

Today, we're going to improve on that, we're going to build forms using a Flask extension called <strong>Flask-WTF</strong>. It has a number of benefits over the simple HTML Form. e.g.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Easy Form Validation</strong> - Makes sure the user is entering data in the required format in all the required fields. e.g. checking that the user's email entry has a \"@\" and a \".\" at the end. All without having to write your own validation code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Less Code</strong> - If you have a number of forms in your website, using WTForm can dramatically reduce the amount of code you have to write (or copy &amp; paste).</p></li><li><p><strong>Built in CSRF Protection</strong> - CSRF stands for <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cross Site Request Forgery</a>, it's an attack that can be made on website forms which forces your users to do unintended actions (e.g. transfer money to a stranger) or compromise your website's security if it's an admin. </p></li></ul><p>Flask developers will usually choose Flask-WTF to create forms in their websites. However, in the wild, you might also see projects that are built with HTML Forms. So it's important to understand how both of them work.</p><p><br></p><h4>Secrets</h4><p>By the end of today, we will build a website that holds some secrets. Only with the right username and password can you access the page with our secrets.</p></body></html>"

This is the ideal setup for all Python projects.</p><p><br></p><h4>Installing packages and the requirements.txt</h4><p>The <strong>requirements.txt</strong> file is a file where you can specify all the dependencies (the installed packages that your project depends on) and their versions. This means that you can share your project without all the installed packages, making it a lot more lightweight.

This is what we think most students should be able to write after reading the Quickstart (and 60 days of Python under their belts). However, if you read the WTForms documentation in its entirety, you'll realise that we can improve the code we wrote.</p><p><br></p><p>1. We can change the <code>password</code> input to use a <code>PasswordField</code> from WTForms, this will obscure the text typed into the input. </p><figure><img src=\"./4. 2020-09-24_15-45-39-2ba57ec9048db9102f6db808cad4a35e.png\"></figure><figure><img src=\"./4. 2020-09-24_15-46-21-016bd6759c031ef83fdfd0b8fa4cbbec.png\"></figure><figure><img src=\"./4. 2020-09-24_15-47-06-081ca46fd3ab669c6defea2a712275a8.png\"></figure><p>There are plenty of other fields you can read about in the WTForms documentation:</p><p><a href=\"https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.x/fields/#basic-fields\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.x/fields/#basic-fields</a></p><p><br></p><p>2. The arguments given when creating a <code>StringField</code> or <code>PasswordField</code> is for the <code>label</code> property of the form field. Even though the Quickstart doesn't add it, I prefer adding the keyword argument when it's not clear what the argument is for.</p><figure><img height=\"101\" src=\"./4. 2020-09-24_15-51-06-bcf849748a0d4c2b81c3bb5a6f4b7853.png\" width=\"518\"></figure><p>This is the <code>label</code> property in use in login.html when our <code>form</code> object is passed over.</p><figure><img height=\"169\" src=\"./4. 2020-09-24_15-52-25-d1d6f216181e8fd6fa401589a0283f86.png\" width=\"739\"></figure><p><br></p><p>3. You might have already done this, but in the Quickstart, they set the form action to <code>\"/\"</code>, which is a static path. It's always a good idea to use dynamically built urls like this:</p><figure><img src=\"./4. 2020-09-24_15-54-14-675456582159ad162aea734ac7cfff3a.png\"></figure><p><br></p><p>4. We can also better format the layout of the labels and inputs in our WTForms generated form by using normal HTML elements. </p><p>e.g. </p><figure><img src=\"./4. 2020-09-24_15-59-37-0d61d7b4311bd3667e8553627be7df5a.png\"></figure><p>This will result in the following layout:</p><figure><img src=\"./4. 2020-09-24_15-59-59-de2a1651bf6b6c6d310c5e271f0ac20b.png\"></figure><p><br></p><p>5.&nbsp; Finally, did you spot the <code>SubmitField</code> when you were looking at the <a href=\"https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.x/fields/#basic-fields\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> in Step 1 ? This can be used to replace the submit input/button.</p><figure><img src=\"./4. 2020-09-24_16-02-35-5034558369f90c27a5139cbd2c2080c8.png\"></figure><figure><img src=\"./4. 2020-09-24_16-03-00-4cf01b09776af46cb4b35c1252248961.png\"></figure><p><br></p><p>This is the code we have after all 5 code improvements:</p><p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/e5b1a26a79888f67b490c1f53ed2496c\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/e5b1a26a79888f67b490c1f53ed2496c</a></p></body></html>"

Instead of us having to write our own validation code e.g. emails should contain a \"@\" and a \".\" to be valid or make sure that passwords are minimum of 8 characters, we can use all these validation rules straight out of the box from WTForms.</p><p><br></p><p>1. We can add validator objects when we create each field in our form. e.g.</p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-09-24_16-13-53-c49cc801108c427a9cadd93de4d8bd32.png\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.x/crash_course/#validators\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Documentation</a></p><p>The <code>validators</code> parameter accepts a <strong>List</strong> of validator <strong>Objects</strong>. DataRequired makes the two fields required fields, so the user must type something, otherwise an error will be generated. </p><p>When a form is submitted, there may be a number of errors, so a List of <code>errors</code> can be generated and passed over to our form HTML as a property on the field which generated the error, e.g.</p><p><code>form.&lt;field&gt;.errors</code> </p><p><br></p><p>2. We can tap into these errors and loop through them to show some text when an error appears. </p><p><a href=\"https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.x/crash_course/#displaying-errors\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Documentation</a></p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-09-24_16-21-04-eb8f05da7a09184f156d6ccd7a1522df.png\"></figure><p><br></p><p>3. The final step is to tell our form to validate the user's entry when they hit submit. so we have to edit our route and make sure it is able to respond to <code>POST</code> requests and then to <code>validate_on_submit()</code>.</p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-09-25_08-13-14-89387e09f36b8f63aae1e33f30c09724.png\"></figure><p><br></p><p>If you tried to test your form at the moment, you will see that if you leave a field empty, it might give you a pop-up e.g. on Chrome:</p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-09-25_08-17-00-ba15d76d052dee8ff49356e05ae3e164.png\"></figure><p>This behaviour is not from our validator, in fact it's a built-in mechanism that varies from browser to browser. You'll see something different on Firefox or Safari. But If your user is running Internet Explorer, they won't see any validation. </p><p>4. In order to make sure that we are giving all users field validation, we have to switch off the browser validation, and we do that with an attribute on the form element called <code>novalidate</code>. </p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-09-25_08-19-40-61810541145037768fb00762759e4aca.png\"></figure><p>Now test your validation, it should give you a warning in red if you leave any field empty and click \"Log In\". e.g.</p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-09-25_08-22-36-16a174fab1853956e451edd94a7f6ffc.png\"></figure><p><br></p><p>CHALLENGE: Using <a href=\"https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.x/validators/#module-wtforms.validators\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the documentation on WTForm validators</a>, add <code>Email</code> validation to the email field so that you must type a <strong>valid email</strong> (with \"@\" and \".\") otherwise you get an error.

In these cases, it's better to use <strong>Template Inheritance</strong> instead.</p><p>Template inheritance is similar to Class inheritance, you can take a parent template and extend its styling in your child web pages. </p><p><br></p><p>For example, if we create a base.html file that has the following code:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;title&gt;{% block title %}{% endblock %}&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; {% block content %}{% endblock %}\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</pre><p>It has predefined areas (or blocks) where new content can be inserted by a child webpage inheriting from this template. </p><p>1. We could re-write the success.html page to inherit from this base.html template:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">#1.\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n#2.\n{% block title %}Success{% endblock %}\n#3.\n{% block content %}\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;h1&gt;Top Secret &lt;/h1&gt;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/Ju7l5y9osyymQ\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/rick-astley-Ju7l5y9osyymQ\"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endblock %}</pre><blockquote><p> #1. This line of code tells the templating engine (Jinja) to use \"base.html\" as the template for this page.</p><p>#2. This block inserts a custom title into the header of the template.</p><p>#3. This block provides the content of the website. The part that is going to vary between webpages. </p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>2. CHALLENGE: Try doing the same thing for denied.html, making sure that it uses the base.html as the template and it has a custom title and content.</p><p>SOLUTION:</p><p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/aa7a7516bf02b1f0f1769dadaf4e6cf4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/aa7a7516bf02b1f0f1769dadaf4e6cf4</a></p><p><br></p><h4>Super Blocks</h4><p>When we inherit from Python classes, you often see <code>super.init()</code></p><p>The super keyword refers to the parent that the child is inheriting from. e.g If Simba inherits from Mufasa, then Mufasa is the super. </p><figure><img src=\"./7. 2020-09-25_09-45-03-659bb054ab4ebba4b8aa3b27006b517d.gif\"></figure><p>When we are inheriting templates. Sometimes, there's some part of the template that we want to keep, but we also want to add to it. So we can use super blocks in this case.</p><p>3. Add the following code to your base.html:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">&lt;style&gt;\n{% block styling %}\nbody{\n    background: purple;\n}\n{% endblock %}\n&lt;/style&gt;</pre><figure><img src=\"./7. 2020-09-25_09-46-43-4426405e7d610f950de5668efbdab551.png\"></figure><p><br></p><p>I named this block \"<code>styling</code>\" but you can call it anything you want. </p><p>Just make sure that you close all blocks with <code>{% endblock %}</code></p><p>Now if you reload your website, you should see that both the success page and the denied page will have a purple background. (We covered inline, internal and external styling in the CSS section of this course - Day 43).</p><figure><img src=\"./7. 2020-09-25_09-50-04-1c8a4d7d0764dffe30dcafbcf8145416.png\"></figure><p><br></p><p>So now you can see how easy it is to modify all web pages in your website if you use the same template. But what if on the denied page we also wanted to make the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> red? We would need to modify the internal styling in the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag. But that code is in the base.html template. Luckily we have super blocks.</p><p><br></p><p>4. On the <strong>denied.html</strong> page, add a super block using <code>{\u200c{ super() }}</code>, this will inject all the code in the styling block to this child page. Then afterwards before the <code>{% endblock %}</code>, we can add some more styling to change the colour of the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>. </p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">{% block styling %}\n   {\u200c{ super() }}\n   h1 {\n      color:red;\n   }\n{% endblock %}</pre><figure><img src=\"./7. 2020-09-25_09-55-57-0a874fed5fa1ec534da7728285032d6b.png\"></figure><p>5. Similar to what you've done with the other html files, using Jinja templating make the success.html file a child template of the base.html as well.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>SOLUTION: Gist with code from this lesson:</p><p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/9842d06ca3b5c1c6668bef0f7f0601cb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/9842d06ca3b5c1c6668bef0f7f0601cb</a></p></body></html>"

        "content": "<html><head></head><body><p>First, let's create a database. The most used database in the world is SQLite. It's so popular that it's included by default in all Python installations, so if you're creating a Python project, you've already got it installed. We're going to create an SQLite database to store our book data.</p><p><br></p><p>Let's briefly play with SQLite in a separate project before we turn our attention back to Library website. </p><p><br></p><p>1. Create a <strong>new</strong> project and inside the main.py file import the <code>sqlite3</code> module. </p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">import sqlite3</pre><p>2. Now create a connection to a new database (if the database does not exist then it will be created).</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">db = sqlite3.connect(\"books-collection.db\")</pre><p>3. Run main.py and you should see a new file appear in PyCharm called <strong>books-collection.db</strong></p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-10-09_16-10-10-dbfb66cc51b0cfec4a716e04980ccb3c.png\"></figure><p>NOTE: Don't try to open the .db file in PyCharm, it won't work, I'll show you how to download the software to open these files a little later.</p><p>4. Next we need to create a <strong>cursor</strong> which will control our database. </p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">cursor = db.cursor()</pre><p>So a cursor is also known as the mouse or pointer. If we were working in Excel or Google Sheet, we would be using the cursor to add rows of data or edit/delete data, we also need a cursor to modify our SQLite database.</p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-10-09_16-06-06-d7cc560a797ad5f9b1840f74f419cc37.png\"></figure><h4>Creating Tables in our Database</h4><p>Coming back to the Excel analogy, a single Excel file can contain many tables (sheets), each tab is a different table. </p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-10-09_16-06-49-4cd308aa9604a2459e7bae69db41696f.png\"></figure><p>Similarly, our database can contain many tables. </p><p>5. Let's create one. Add this code below all the previous lines.</p><p><code>cursor.execute(\"CREATE TABLE books (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title varchar(250) NOT NULL UNIQUE, author varchar(250) NOT NULL, rating FLOAT NOT NULL)\")</code> </p><p>Let's break this down.</p><p><code>cursor</code> - We created this in step 4 and this is the mouse pointer in our database that is going to do all the work.</p><p><code>.execute()</code> - This method will tell the cursor to execute an action. All actions in SQLite databases are expressed as SQL&nbsp;(Structured Query Language) commands. These are almost like English sentences with keywords written in ALL-CAPS. There are <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/articles/sql-commands\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">quite a few SQL commands</a>. But don't worry, you don't have to memorise them.</p><p><code>CREATE TABLE</code> -&nbsp; This will create a new table in the database. The name of the table comes after this keyword.</p><p>Docs: <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_create_table.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_create_table.asp</a></p><p><code>books</code> -&nbsp; This is the name that we've given the new table we're creating.</p><p><code>()</code> -&nbsp; The parts that come inside the parenthesis after <code>CREATE&nbsp;TABLE&nbsp;books</code> are going to be the fields in this table. Or you can imagine it as the Column headings in an Excel sheet.</p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-10-09_16-07-02-8c7636816809afb33257c09104c60666.jpg\"></figure><p><code>id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY</code> -&nbsp; This is the first field. It's a field called \"<code>id</code>\" which is of data type <code>INTEGER</code> and it will be the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code>&nbsp;for this table. The primary key is the one piece of data that will uniquely identify this record in the table. e.g. The primary key of humans might be their passport number because no two people in the same country have the same passport number.</p><p><code>title varchar(250) NOT NULL UNIQUE</code> -&nbsp; This is the second field. It's called \"<code>title</code>\" and it accepts a variable-length string composed of characters. The 250 in brackets is the maximum length of the text. <code>NOT NULL</code>&nbsp;means it must have a value and cannot be left empty. <code>UNIQUE</code> means no two records in this table can have the same title. </p><p><code>author varchar(250) NOT NULL</code> -&nbsp; A field that accepts variable-length Strings up to 250 characters called <code>author</code> that cannot be left empty.</p><p><code>rating FLOAT NOT NULL</code> -&nbsp; A field that accepts FLOAT data type numbers, cannot be empty and the field is called <code>rating</code>.</p><p><br></p><p>6. Run the code from step 5 and there will be no noticeable changes. In order to view our database we need to download some specialised software. </p><p>Head over to the link below and download DB&nbsp;Browser for your operating system. (If you are on Windows go for the Standard Installer).</p><p><a href=\"https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/</a></p><p>7.

Navigate to your project location (it should in a folder called PyCharm Projects) and open the books-collection.db</p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-10-09_16-07-59-5ca5b438d54f7066d6bd5ffe366640a7.png\"></figure><p>Now you should see a table called books that contains 4 fields:</p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-10-09_16-10-32-15b1d88e656944aa341321b675bcdef4.png\"></figure><p>This is our database. </p><p>9. To add data to our table we can head back to main.py and write the following code:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO books VALUES(1, 'Harry Potter', 'J. K. Rowling', '9.3')\")\ndb.commit()</pre><p>This will create a new entry in our books table for the Harry Potter book and commit the changes to our database.</p><p>10. Now comment out the previous line of code where you are created the table called books. Otherwise, you'll get <code>sqlite3.OperationalError: table books already exists</code>. </p><p>11. Then close down the database in DB&nbsp;Browser by clicking Close Database. Otherwise, you'll get a warning about <code>database locked</code> when you work with the database in PyCharm.</p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-10-09_16-10-46-1f7da428fc59e8d2f6eda90be3e19907.png\"></figure><p>12. Now run the code in main.py and re-open the database in DB&nbsp;Browser to see the updated books table. it should look like this:</p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-10-09_16-11-24-7a7fecdf28d9cd5dd5bf0376488ca6eb.png\"></figure><p>SQL queries are very sensitive to typos. If instead of writing:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO books VALUES(1, 'Harry Potter', 'J. K.

Rowling', '9.3')\")\ndb.commit()</pre><p>Then it won't work at all (can you even spot the difference in the code?)</p><p>Luckily, there are much better ways of working with SQLite in Python projects, we can use a tool called SQLAlchemy to write Python code instead of all these error-prone SQL commands. That's what we'll do in the next lesson!</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/TheMuellenator/e488a02c791fc1f2dd010f13facecca0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Code Snippet from this lesson.</a></p></body></html>"

What is the <code>:</code> used for?&nbsp;Explicitly declaring a variable type. Below we are explicitly saying that <code>id</code> is of type <code>Mapped</code>. SQLAlchemy uses the generic <code>Mapped</code> so that it can <a href=\"https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/declarative_tables.html#using-annotated-declarative-table-type-annotated-forms-for-mapped-column\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">type check</a> the data that will be stored in the database. </p><p> </p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">class Book(db.Model):\n    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    title: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(250), unique=True, nullable=False)\n    author: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(250), nullable=False)\n    rating: Mapped[float] = mapped_column(Float, nullable=False)\n\nwith app.app_context():\n    db.create_all()</pre><p><br></p><p>In addition to these things, the most crucial thing to figure out when working with any new database technology is how to <strong>CRUD </strong>data records. </p><p><strong>C</strong>reate</p><p><strong>R</strong>ead</p><p><strong>U</strong>pdate</p><p><strong>D</strong>elete</p><p><br></p><p>So, let's go through each of these using SQLite and SQLAlchemy:</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Create</strong> A New Record</h4><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">with app.app_context():\n    new_book = Book(id=1, title=\"Harry Potter\", author=\"J.

When we execute a query during a database session we get back the rows in the database (a <code>Result</code> object). We then use <code>scalars()</code> to get the individual elements rather than entire rows. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Read</strong> A Particular Record By Query</h4><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">with app.app_context():\n    book = db.session.execute(db.select(Book).where(Book.title == \"Harry Potter\")).scalar()</pre><p>To get a single element we can use <code>scalar()</code> instead of <code>scalars()</code>. </p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Update</strong> A Particular Record By Query</h4><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">with app.app_context():\n    book_to_update = db.session.execute(db.select(Book).where(Book.title == \"Harry Potter\")).scalar()\n    book_to_update.title = \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\"\n    db.session.commit() </pre><p><br></p><h4><strong>Update</strong> A Record By PRIMARY&nbsp;KEY</h4><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">book_id = 1\nwith app.app_context():\n    book_to_update = db.session.execute(db.select(Book).where(Book.id == book_id)).scalar()\n    # or book_to_update = db.get_or_404(Book, book_id)  \n    book_to_update.title = \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\"\n    db.session.commit()  </pre><p>Flask-SQLAlchemy also has some handy <a href=\"https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/queries/#queries-for-views\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">extra query methods</a> like <code>get_or_404()</code> that we can use.

Create an SQLite database with <a href=\"https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/quickstart/#initialize-the-extension\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SQLAlchemy</a>. The database needs to contain a \"Movie\" Table. This table should contain the following fields:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">id \ntitle \nyear \ndescription \nrating \nranking\nreview\nimg_url</pre><p>The <code>title</code> should be <code>unique</code>. That way you only get one entry per movie title in your ranking. </p><p>Remember, your database will be stored in the <strong>instance</strong> folder, so you'll have to create this folder. </p><p>2. Using code/DB&nbsp;Viewer, add a new entry to the database with the following values:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">new_movie = Movie(\n    title=\"Phone Booth\",\n    year=2002,\n    description=\"Publicist Stuart Shepard finds himself trapped in a phone booth, pinned down by an extortionist's sniper rifle.

You won't see anything on the website just yet, but you can see your entry in the movies.db.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>3. Add second movie to your database.

In a lot of cases, the API allows us to tap into a particular website's data or service. </p><p>Many companies have collected valuable data e.g. Bitcoin prices, Restaurant reviews and provide an API for developers to access this data for a price. Depending on how valuable the data/service is behind the API, these APIs can charge anywhere from $9 to $99 per month for access. Some even charge per API call. </p><p>What if you have access to some information that other people might want to use? E.g. You collected data on all the cafes in a particular city and figured out which ones were suitable for remote-work?

But cafes often change their prices. What if a user wanted to submit a change in price at one of the cafes?</p><p>If they knew the <code>id</code> of the caf\u00e9 (which they can get by making a GET request to fetch data on all the cafes), then they can update the <code>coffee_price</code> field of the caf\u00e9. </p><p>In this situation, a <code>PATCH</code> request is probably more efficient, as we don't need to change any of the rest of the cafe's data. </p><p>1. Create a <code>PATCH</code> request route in main.py to handle PATCH requests to our API. In order for our API to be RESTful, ideally, the route should be something like this:</p><p><code>/update-price/&lt;cafe_id&gt;</code></p><p>So the user might go to <code>localhost:5000/update-price/22</code> and that would update the caf\u00e9 with an id of 22. </p><p>HINT 1: You can use <code>.get()</code> with a <code>try</code> <code>except</code> pattern to get a caf\u00e9 by a particular id. Return an error message in a json if you encounter an <code>AttributeError</code>. </p><p>HINT 2: The user will also need to provide the updated price of a single black coffee by passing it with the request as a parameter.</p><p>Change the request type inside Postman to <strong>PATCH</strong>.

      "if you were Spotify or Netflix and you charge a subscription for accessing certain parts of the website, then once the user pays, you have to update their account in your database to say that they have paid and they'll be allowed to access the TV shows or songs that they're entitled to. So those are some of the reasons why you might want to add authentication to your website. But authentication can be done in a number of ways. Creating a website where we sign up and log in users seems simple enough, but the difficult part of authentication comes from how secure you're going to make your website. But so we're going to learn how to progress from essentially a website that's basically secured with a Cheeto to something that is a lot more serious and more consistent with industry standards of good security on a website. So the structure of our website is really, really simple. It has a homepage which has two buttons that allows you to either go towards register or go towards login. And once the user has been registered or logged in and they have been authenticated, then they are able to access the secrets page. So I've kept the remainder of the website pretty simple because we're going to be focusing on a pretty complex topic. So I've created some starting files for you to download so that we can focus our efforts on learning authentication and not get distracted by things like bootstrap and styling. So once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and download the starting files, and then we're going to get started with authentication. So I'll see you there. All right, so we've taken a look at level one encryption, which is basically just storing the password as plain text in our database. So maybe it'll be a little bit difficult for people to get access to our server and access our database. At least you can't just simply right- click on a website to view page source and be able to see it in the HTML. At least it's stored at server level. But that's not really good enough. So let's go ahead and see what we can do to improve the security for our users on our website. So let's increase to level two authentication. And level two authentication involves the use of encryption. So what exactly is encryption? Well, basically all it is is just scrambling something so that people can't tell what the original was unless they were in on the secret and they knew how to unscramble it. This is exactly the same as if you and your friend were sending each other secret messages and you had a key to encode the message that you both knew that so that you could decode the message. Now, on a bigger scale, if you've ever watched The Imitation Game or read about the Enigma machine, well, that is basically a form of encryption. And the Enigma machine, if you don't know, is just simply a machine that was used during World War 2 when the Germans would send each other messages, they would use the machine to encrypt those messages so that when the messages are intercepted, say, over the radio, unless you had the same Enigma machine and you knew what the decoding key was or what the settings were for the machine, then you wouldn't be able to tell what it is that they were trying to communicate with each other. If you're interested, I really recommend watching two videos that were done by Numberphile on YouTube and I've linked to it in the course resources list. But it explains the Enigma machine and it talks about the flaw in the Enigma machine that led Alan Turing and other people at Bletchley Park to be able to crack the code and create what was very much a specialized computer to be able to decode those messages and helped the allies win the war. And if you ever visit London, be sure to go and check out Bletchley Park and they have a computer museum next to it as well, which is super fascinating. Anyways, I digress. So back to ciphers and encryption, one of the earliest ways of encrypting messages that we know about is the Caesar cipher. And this comes from Julius Caesar, who was one of the generals in the Roman Empire. And what he did is he would send messages to his generals and he would encrypt it so if his messenger got murdered along the way, then his messages would be kept secret. And this is one of the simplest forms of encryption we know about and it's very simple. Let's say we have the alphabet, right? ABCDEFG. All that the Caesar Cipher does is a letter substitution cipher. And the key for the cipher is the number of letters that you would shift by. So if you knew what the shift pattern was, then you could really quickly decipher the message. So if we were to encrypt the word hello, there's a really neat tool online that can help us do that. It's called cryptii.com and it's got two 'i's at the end. And you can basically choose the kind of cipher or encryption that you want to use and then you can specify the shift and we're going to say a shift of three, let's say. So if my text was hello, then it becomes shifted into khoor. And to an unknowing person and a non-cryptographer, it can be quite difficult to see at a glance what exactly this is trying to say. Now in modern days and with modern cryptography, this is overly simplistic and it's very, very easy to crack. But there are other forms of encryption which are a little bit more complicated and it involves a lot more math to make it more time consuming for somebody to crack. But essentially all encryption works exactly the same way. You have a way of scrambling your message and it requires a key to be able to unscramble that message. All right. So now it's time to level up to the next level of security. And in this lesson, we're going to cover something called hashing. Now, previously, we've already looked at encryption, so taking the user's password and securing it using an encryption key, and then using a particular cipher method, be it a Caesar cipher or the Enigma cipher, no matter which way we chose, we always had a password, a key, and we ended up with some ciphertext which will make it hard for people to be able to immediately guess what our user's password is. So, for example, if we took a password like qwerty and we use the Caesar cipher method and we decided to shift it by one, then our encryption key is the number one. And that creates the ciphertext where every single letter is shifted up by one. Now, in order to decrypt this, all you have to do, as long as you know what the key is, then you can simply shift all of the ciphertext down by one and you end up with the original password. Now, the Caesar cipher is a very, very weak encryption method. It's incredibly easy to figure out what the original text was, even if you didn't have a key. And just to illustrate what bad things can happen when you have a weak encryption system, I'm going to tell you a story from history that tells us why we should not be using a weak encryption system. So back in the 1500's on this island that we now call the United Kingdom, there used to be two large areas. One was Scotland and the other was England. And they were ruled over by two Queens. Scotland was ruled by Mary Queen of Scots, who was a Catholic, and England was ruled over by Queen Elizabeth the first. Now, these two ladies between them controlled the land that we now call the UK, but they each wanted to have more power and more land. So what did they do? Well, Mary Queen of Scots who ruled over Scotland decided to plot with her friend, Lord Babington, to try and assassinate Queen Elizabeth. That way, she would be the legitimate heir to both the English and Scottish throne, and it was kind of a Game of Thrones kind of situation going on back then. But in order to mobilize their forces or try to come up with some sort of secret plan, they decided to send letters to each other using ciphertext. So they came up with a system to encrypt their letters to each other such that if it fell into the wrong hands, the subject of the letter wouldn't be revealed and they wouldn't end up being tried for treason. But the problem was that the encryption method that they used, which was a letter substitution method similar to the Caesar cipher, was a very weak form of encryption. And Queen Elizabeth had a chief decoder who ended up deciphering their letters and figuring out what their encryption key was. So he decided to take this encryption key and write a letter back to Lord Babington to try and get him to reveal all of the co-conspirators. And what was the end result of having their weak encryption system? Well, Queen Elizabeth decided to accuse Mary Queen of Scots of treason, and hence she ended up having her head chopped off. So this is not what you want to happen to you or your website. So weak encryption systems can end up putting user passwords at risk and your company might end up metaphorically decapitated, such as in the case of companies like TalkTalk or Equifax, where they ended up getting hacked and lost a lot of the trust of their users. Now, if you're interested in more stories like this and to learn more about cryptography and encryption, there's a really great book recommendation I would make called The Code Book by Simon Singh. It contains stories like the one that I just told you and more. So if you're interested in this, go ahead and read more about it. Now, how can we make our password more secure Now, at the moment, the biggest flaw in our authentication method is the fact that we need an encryption key to encrypt our passwords and decrypt our passwords. And chances are that if somebody is motivated enough to spend time and hack into your database, then it's probably not that difficult for them to also be able to get your encryption key, even if you've saved it in environment variable or somewhere secure on your server. So how can we address this weakest link, the need for that encryption key? Well, here is where hashing comes into play. Whereas previously with encryption we needed that encryption key, hashing takes it away and no longer requires the need for an encryption key. Well, then you might ask, well, if we don't have an encryption key, how can we decrypt our password back into plain text? Well, the secret is you don't. Let's say a user registers on our website and they enter a password to register with, we use something called a hash function to turn that password into a hash and we store that hash in our database. Now, the problem is that hash functions are mathematical equations that are designed to make it almost impossible to go backwards. So it's almost impossible to turn a hash back into a password. How is this possible, you might ask? How is it possible that you can turn a password into a hash very quickly and easily, but make it almost impossible to turn that hash back into a password? Well, here's a question. Let me ask you, what are the factors of 377 other than one and 377? So basically, I'm saying 377 is not a prime number. Not only can you divide 377 by 1 and 377, but there's also two other numbers that you can divide it by. Now it's your job to figure out what those numbers are. So, what might you do? Well, you might divide it by two. OK, so that becomes 188.5. That's not a whole number so 2 is not a factor. What if you divide it by three? Well, that becomes 113.3 recurring, which is also not a whole number. So three is not a factor either. And you might go through this process for a long time, tediously going through number by number. Well, then you might arrive at the point where you divide 377 by 13 and you end up with 29. So 13 and 29 are the answers to this question. They are the only factors of 377 other than 1 and 377. And as you can see, that process of getting to this point of finding those two factors took us a while, right? It wasn't that easy. But consider if I asked you a different question. If I said to you, can you multiply 13 by 29? Well, you would be able to do that really quickly and easily. It would take you almost no time at all to figure out that the answer is 377. So here is a very, very simplified version of a hash function. So going forward, multiplying 13 by 29 is really quick and easy, but going backward, trying to get back those numbers 13 and 29 starting from 377 is very, very time consuming. So this is essentially how a hash function works. Just add a little bit more complexity and you end up with a real hash function. So they're designed to be calculated very quickly going forwards, but almost impossible to go backward. And by almost impossible I simply mean that using current levels of computing power, it would take far too long to make it worthwhile for the hacker. So let's say that to calculate the hash going forward, it takes a millisecond, but to go backward it takes two years, then that hacker probably has better things to do with his time. So when a user tries to register on our website, then we ask them for the registration password, which we turn into a hash using our hash function, and then we store that hash on our database. Now, at a later point when the user tries to log in and they type in their password, then we again hash that password that they typed in to produce a hash and then we compare it against the hash that we have stored in our database. And if those two hashes match, then that must mean that the login password is the same as the registration password as well. And at no point in this process do we have to store their password in plain text or are we able to reverse the process to figure out their original password? The only person who knows their password is the user themselves. Now, previously we saw that by using the Enigma machine, as long as we knew what the settings were for the Enigma machine, which is basically the encryption key, right? As long as we knew what that was, then I can decode it by setting it to the same encryption key. And we end up being able to retrieve the original text. Now, however, if I was to go and change this to a hash function instead, then you can see that when we try to decode this using the same hash function, MD5, we get the error that decoding step is not defined for hash function because you can't really go back. That's the whole point of the hash function and this is what will make our authentication more secure. All right, guys. So now that we've covered creating user passwords, encrypting our database, as well as hashing passwords, we've kind of reached a level of security that most websites are at. Now, there's a lot more security that we're going to learn about a little bit later on. But you're actually at a point where you already know quite a lot about authentication and keeping user passwords secure, and definitely a lot more than a lot of people who actually run websites. And I know that some of you guys are keen to get a job. And if that is you, then I want you to go onto a website called plaintextoffenders.com. I'll link to it in the course resources. But here what you'll find is emails that come from various companies where the users requested to reset their password and they're sending the user a plain text version of their password. Now, at this point, we know to be able to even get the user's password in plain text, it means that they're doing some horrible things with securing the passwords. Either it's encrypted and there's an encryption key somewhere that they're storing or it's simply just stored on their database as plain text, which is the worst possible type of security. So given that you already know a lot better than the people who run getlinuxjobs.com or world sim.com or Telecom Egypt, then you could actually just email these people and tell them that I'm a web developer and I know about authentication and securing users passwords. You obviously seem like you might need some help. Would you like me to work for you? I recommend giving that a go too if you're keen on getting a job. If you're not looking for a job, then have a look at these websites. And if you're signed up to any of them, be sure to delete your account because it's definitely not secure. And this is why a lot of companies and a lot of websites get hacked because they don't continue beyond this point. So that means it's a really good time to talk to you about how passwords are hacked, so a sort of hacking Passwords 101 class if you will. Now, most of the time, I use my programming powers for good. But in this case, I want to talk to you about how passwords might be hacked so that once we understand how the other side approaches this problem, then we can learn more about security and make our website safer for users. And by the way, I have no idea why hackers are always portrayed in a balaclava. It's not like they're going to burgle anybody. I mean, especially this guy, he must be incredibly warm sitting next to all these computers, wearing so much clothing on his face. But I digress. So as a company, this is probably one of the things that you least look forward to. The day when you wake up and you get a call and you've been hacked. And this has happened really recently to a lot of big companies like Adobe Creative Cloud got hacked in 2013, LinkedIn got hacked in 2012. And there's loads of accounts where their passwords get leaked. Lots of unhappy users who reuse their passwords and are feeling extremely vulnerable. And you can see that even to this day, people can purchase these hacked accounts where people might not have realized that their LinkedIn email and their passwords are linked and people are potentially buying that data up and using it to hack into their PayPal accounts or other similar payment portals. So even if you don't learn anything from this lesson, I recommend just going to this website. I'll link to it in the course resources just for educational purposes. But put in your email address and make sure that if you do have any passwords that show up, change all the places where you use that password. But why is it that all of these big companies are getting hacked and leaking their users passwords? Are they not at least encrypting or hashing their passwords? Well, they are. But consider this. So you're a hacker and you've managed to get into the LinkedIn user database. And just for simplicity's sake, let's say it looks like this. You've got a username and you've got a hash. And thankfully, they didn't store their users' passwords in plain text, so you can't access their passwords straight away. However, if you look at this table a little bit more closely, you will realize that three of the hashes are completely identical. Now, why might that be? Well, remember that the same password always turns into the same hash no matter how often you try it. And that's a core part of the hash function that we rely on in order to validate our users as well. That means a hacker would look at this table and realize that Angela, Tony, and Emily all have the same password, and what they can do is they can start to construct what we call a hash table. So you would take some of the most commonly used passwords and you would use the same hash function to create the hash value for each of those. And these are some of the most common passwords that people love to use. 123456, qwerty, password, 111111. And so you generate this hash table and then all you have to do is just look up the hash of the user and compare it against the hash you have in your table. So you search by the hash value and you land upon the password, which is qwerty. So now you've figured out that three out of four users in this table all have the same password and it's qwerty. So what if they didn't use one of the most common passwords and instead they use something else, say their date of birth or their pet's name? Well, let's see how we would make a hash table if we were a hacker. You would probably start with all the words from a dictionary, and this is where the term dictionary attack comes from. You create hashes from all the possible words in a dictionary, and that will only be about 150,000 hashes that you would need to create. And then you add to that hash table all the numbers from a telephone book and all the combination of characters up to six places. And then you add all of these together and you end up with something close to 19.8 billion combinations, which admittedly sounds like a large number, right? How long would it take your computer to calculate that many hashes? So what do we do? Well, let's go shopping. Let's go and buy some of the latest GPUs or graphics cards which are capable of parallel processing and therefore are particularly suited to not only Bitcoin mining, but also generating hashes. With one of the latest GPS, you can calculate about 20 billion MD5 hashes per second. So that means with our hash table of 19.8 billion combinations, it'll only take one of these GPUs 0.9 seconds, which is nothing. It's not a lot of time to invest in order to hash so many people's passwords. And to make it even worse, large hash tables have been built for the most common passwords. So because we've had so much data from previous hacks such as the Adobe one or the LinkedIn one or TalkTalk or Equifax, we know what the most common passwords are that people use. And every year companies like Splash Data will compile what are the most common passwords, say the top 25. And this is where all of those values that went into our table came from. But you can actually go one step further. There are pre-built hash tables that people have created for the top 10,000 most common passwords. And you can see that MD5 is one of the quickest hashes to calculate. And this is why it's very, very common to find MD5 hash tables. And you can even use Google as a basic hash table. You can paste in the hash that you found from the hacked database. You perform a simple Google search and you come up with the original password. Now, if at this point you're extremely scared and you're wondering, well, what exactly can you do about this? Well, consider that in our user table, there was one hash that was extremely difficult to find and it didn't match up with any of the hashes in this little simple hash table we built. So what if we put that into Google to search on a larger scale and see if it matches any of the hashes in the hash tables that people have generated? And it doesn't. It doesn't match anything. And the reason is because when John created his password, he had a very, very strong password with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, but most importantly, a long password. When you think about hashing as a mathematical formula, you'll realize that as the number of characters of your password increases, the computation time that it takes to crack it increases exponentially. So it doesn't matter if your account on LinkedIn or Adobe  Creative Cloud or Ashley Madison was cracked, as long as you had a strong password, they wouldn't be able to work it out from a hash table. So as an example, there's a website called Password Checker and you can put in your password and it'll tell you not only the strength, but also how long it will take various types of machines to be able to crack that password. So let's say that I create a six-character password composed of a random set of characters, right? 123456. And you can see that even for a standard desktop PC, it only takes about three seconds to perform a brute force attack to crack that password. But let's see what happens if I add another six more characters. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Now, it takes 31 years for a standard desktop PC to be able to crack it and even a fast GPU takes two years to crack my password. So even though all of the websites encourage you to add a capital letter, lowercase letter, some numbers and some random characters, if you only have six characters in your password, so a short password, it still doesn't take very long to crack. So the most important thing of creating a strong password that is almost uncrackable is just to increase the number of characters. And also to prevent yourself from being a victim of a dictionary attack, just make sure that you don't use a dictionary word or a place name or something that is in a directory somewhere like a telephone number. All right. So at least after this lesson, you'll know how to keep yourself more secure. But in the next lesson, we're going to address these vulnerabilities that occur because of weak hashing algorithms, and we're going to learn how we can combat hackers who try to attack our database using a dictionary attack or by creating a hash table. So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson. But as a quick bonus, if you ever want to trick your friends into thinking that you're some sort of a hacker, at least according to Hollywood, I recommend checking out a website called hackertyper .net where you can just mash the keyboard and you end up with something that looks extremely realistic. But a word of warning:",
      "while for the hacker.

But in the next lesson, we're going to address these vulnerabilities that occur because of weak hashing algorithms, and we're going to learn how we can combat hackers who try to attack our database using a dictionary attack or by creating a hash table. So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson. But as a quick bonus, if you ever want to trick your friends into thinking that you're some sort of a hacker, at least according to Hollywood, I recommend checking out a website called hackertyper .net where you can just mash the keyboard and you end up with something that looks extremely realistic.

The User should be the parent and the BlogPost will be child. You should be able to easily locate the BlogPosts a User has written and also the User of any BlogPost object.</p><p>Note, you will be changing the schema here by adding an foreign key, the <code>author_id</code>. This will be <em>a breaking change</em>. The blog website will not work after you have made this change. </p><p>Hint:</p><figure><img src=\"./6. 2020-10-22_15-07-00-4679331675d5acf634ac041b5eb8ae85.png\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/TheMuellenator/b4e21f77c04afcac85a7ec2a262ea0d7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SOLUTION</a> </p><p>Don't panic if re-run your blog at this point and see this error:</p><p><code>OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such column: blog_posts.author_id</code></p><p><br></p><figure><img src=\"./6. 2023-08-01_11-50-24-43a775adae975e113ebb8382084c98d9.png\"></figure><p><br></p><h4>Re-create the database with a new admin user and posts</h4><p>Our old database is no longer compatible with the new database structure - there are no entries for <code>author_id</code> in the old posts. </p><p>Our new code in the main.py modifies our database model by adding a new column into our database that was not present in the original <code>blog.db</code>&nbsp; from the starter code: </p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">author_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey(\"users.id\"))</pre><p><br></p><figure><img src=\"./6. 2021-01-27_12-33-41-7750e803240c2005248a78ccc259015e.png\"></figure><p>There is no need to preserve the sample data and testing data so we will delete the database and create a new one from scratch. However, this raises an important point: database schemas need to be defined early during the development process. Once an application has launched and accumulated lots of data, you will need to preserve this data by <em>migrating </em>to the new database. Lucky for us, we can leave out the migration step.</p><p><strong>Stop your server and delete the existing blog.db</strong> <strong>entirely. </strong>Untick safe delete when prompted and confirm deletion.</p><figure><img src=\"./6. 2023-08-01_11-50-24-f1363b4c929cf3837e48233a0c9a5f03.gif\"></figure><p><strong>Restart your server and register a new admin user</strong>. </p><figure><img src=\"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-08-01_11-50-24-d5caa97055138f8ccd7ad1d563e049dd.gif\"></figure><p>Also create a new post since we've just wiped our database.

So say if you worked within a team and you're all working on a product, then everybody in the team probably has both read and write permissions on a single remote repository and that way they can \"git clone\" and work on it locally and then push it and resolve any sort of conflicts that way, but you don't want anybody on the Internet having those kind of permissions. So how do you implement this kind of open source collaboration then? Well, it's through Forking and making Pull requests. So now let's say that evil Angela, Bangela has forked my repository. So on her GitHub account, she now owns a copy of my repository and from this point she can then clone that repository to work on it locally. And if she decides to add some features to it, maybe, you know, improve the code base or add some more code or do something crazy or whatever it is that she wants, then after she's happy with that and she's committed those changes, then she can push it to her remote repository. And then if she wants me or good Angela to incorporate those changes that she made, then her only option is to make a \"Pull request\", if she is not within that trusted pool of people who all have read and write access to my remote repository. So say if she only has read access, then she would have to make a Pull request. And it's almost like making a suggestion. Here are some suggested changes that I've been working on, what do you think about it? If you okay it, then please, you know, merge it to your remote repository. The reason why it's called a Pull request and not a push request is because the person who has the write permission to the repository, so I have write permission to my own remote repository, which has been forked and duplicated by, you know, my evil twin. If she wants to incorporate those changes, then I have the deciding vote so I can review those changes and I can pull the changes over. So it's not a push because you don't own the rights to the remote repository that you're trying to push to. In this case, if I decide after a code review that actually those features that she added were pretty great and it seems compatible with my code so far and doesn't break anything, then I would approve the pull request and merge her repository with my own, so the changes will be reflected in a new commit. So let's take a look at this in action. So here we've got our original Story repository. So this is a remote repository, remember, because it's hosted online on GitHub and we've got a number of commits and we've been doing some modifications and writing to write our storyline. Now I'm going to log out of my account. So that was the account that created the Story and then I'm going to sign in using a different account. So right now I'm signed in to a different GitHub account. This account is named \"gilfoyleismyothername\", and now I'm going to search for that repository. So I found the Story repository by the user angelabauer. So that was the one that we saw earlier on. So I'm going to go into this repository, and you can see that all of these lines and files are publicly visible and you can read through all of it even though you are now not signed in to the account that created this repository. From here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to Fork this repository. As we mentioned before, forking is simply making a copy or a duplicate of a remote repository and putting it under your own GitHub account. You can see this user that I've created is called gilfoyleismyothername, and now I have this repository under my own username, so I've made a copy of it and you can see it's exactly the same as before. Everything's been copied over, including all of the previous commits that were made. So from here I'm going to make some changes. So let's maybe change one of these storylines. So let's change chapter 4. So let's say that this other user, this other person has some suggested improvements to my code, or in this case, to my writing. They're still keeping the spirit of the original repository alive because we are now converting into a space-theme or an alien-theme. So I've made my changes to chapter4, and I'm going to commit those changes saying, \"Add more space- themes to chapter 4.\" So that's what I did, and I'm going to commit to the master branch. So this is the master branch of my own forked copy of the Story repository. So once I commit those changes, then we can view what it currently looks like under the Graphs. If we have a look at the Network, you can see that this is the point where I forked the story repository and that commit was created by Angela Yu, which basically merged this branch to the master branch. So we did that two lessons back, if you remember. The latest commit though, is made by this current user, gilfoyleismyothername, and you can see that I've added it to the master branch of my forked copy of that repository. Say, if I now open up a incognito window and I log back in to the Angela account and go over to that Story repository, you can see that if I have a look inside my Graphs go into Network that that latest change, it's not reflected on my master branch. It's showing up as a separate branch made by gilfoylismyothername and you can see the members who have forked your repository. This is a great way of collaborating because you can have contributors, make edits or add new features to your pre-existing code base or repository. And now what I can do if I head back to the Gilfoyle account, so I'm just going to flip through these two so that you can see, right now I'm inside the Gilfoyle account, and this is the angelabauer account. Now, under the Gilfoyle account, what I can do is I can make a Pull request. We can do that here and you can see that it's able to merge. And these are the changes. So swapping that word for that word, swapping that word for that phrase. Now, all I have to do is hit Create Pull request and tell the original author, which is Angela Bauer, what I've done, why I think my modifications or my features are worthy to be merged with the original repository. And you know, any other notes, right? Any other comments that I have. Let's just say... Always helps to be complimentary. Now, let's go ahead and create a Pull request. The pull request is done, but if we have a look back into the Story repository, you can see that those changes are not made right? It's because I don't own this repository. I don't have write access, only have read access as a member of the general public and not a member of the trusted inner circle. So I can only suggest my changes. If we head over back to the angelabauer account who owns this repository. Now, if I have a look under Pull requests, I've got a brand new Pull request, right? So it previously was 0, but now I have 1 and it's showing as 1 Open Pull request. And this is added a minute ago by Gilfoyle and if I look at it, I can see why he thinks that this modification is necessary and what were his commit message. And I can also take a look at the commits that he made and compare the differences. So review those changes. So I could say something like, great job, Gilfoyle. And I can submit this feedback to Gilfoyle and approve merging these changes. Now, all I have to do is hit Merge pull request and maybe add a, \"Merged from Gilfoyle's modifications to chapter 4.\" Okay, so let's go ahead and confirm the merge. And now you can see that that commit is added to angelabauer, master. So if I have a look inside my Graphs now, you can see that the latest commit was my merge and you can see where it came from. It came from a fork made by Gilfoyle, which shows up as a separate branch, and then it got merged back into the main branch of the main repository. So some people use GitHub purely as version control for their own projects and use some of the features that we discussed in previous lessons, but there's also a huge community of awesome coders on here who have created really brilliant projects and if you can see ways of improving it or contributing to it, then it's a great way of starting to learn how to work in a team of programmers, which is a really essential skill when you're working for a startup or for a company. So, for example, if we have a look at the Alamofire repository, if you have a look at the contributions, you can see that there have been loads and loads of other users who have looked at the code and done things, you know, or made suggestions, and to steadily improve this framework that, you know, everybody else is benefiting off, right? You can see that a total of 4300 forks have been made and there's currently four open pull requests, but 559 pull requests were closed. So let's have a look. So, for example, in this case, this guy updated the Readme to the current version. So that's obviously just editing a text file and that's pretty much within anybody's capabilities, right? And then it got merged by somebody who owned this repository and they gave them a bit of feedback. Right? But there's other things like, you know, code additions or code deletions or modifications that people have made. So this guy made some fixes and he's documented: what were the goals, what were the implementation details, what were the tests that he performed? And then the guy who owned the repository said, hey, just, you know, maybe one thing that you need to change. Have a look in here. And then once it was changed, then it was approved and merged with the master branch. Have a look around on GitHub and see what are some of the cool projects that you could maybe get involved in. To begin with, have a look at the libraries that you've been using and if you want, you can build on top of it, either for your own goals and purposes, but also, you know, if you're building on top of somebody else's open-source code, then it's a nice thing to contribute back to the open source world by forking and making a pull request to offer your improvements or bug fixes or new features. As I said, it's almost like a social network for programmers, and you can make a lot of great friends on here, and you can also get a lot of help on here in your development journey. So I hope you enjoyed all of that and I will see you on the next lesson. All right guys, in this lesson, we'll go through the installation steps to install Git Bash and Git on Windows. Mac already comes with Bash pre-installed, so if you're working on a Mac, you can skip this lesson and head over straight to the next lesson. Now, the first thing you're going to do is you're going to navigate to Git for Windows and you're going to download the Git SCM. Now, once that's downloaded, go ahead and open up the installer and select Yes. And then you're going to agree to the license by clicking Next, select the location where you're going to install Git. On this next step where it asks you to select which components should be installed, make sure that this checkbox next to Git Bash is selected and is checked as yes. Now go ahead and leave the defaults for the rest and click Next, and then leave the default Git as the folder and click Next, and then keep clicking Next and going with the default selected options. Select Next, and Next, and Next. (chuckles) And just basically keep selecting Next and keeping the default selections from the installer. Now, once installation is completed, let's make sure that it works. So let's open up the VS Code and open up a terminal, and you can find that on the top menu. Click Terminal, New Terminal. And then in this new terminal, click on that dropdown button next to the plus sign and select Git Bash. Now you should see something similar to this with a dollar sign in the terminal. Now, in order to configure VS Code to make Git Bash your default shell, we have to go to the command palette, and we can find that by going to View, Command Palette. And then in the command palette, we're going to search for Select Default Profile. And once that comes up in the dropdown, select it, and then select Git Bash. And this is going to set it so that, every time you open up a new terminal, we're working with Git Bash as the selected terminal. So let's try it out. Let's click... Close down that terminal, select a new one, and you can see Bash showing as the profile for our terminal. And there you have it. In this module, I want to introduce you to how Git works and how you can use it to achieve various powerful ends. And I'm going to be talking about and showing you how you can use Git on the command line to do things such as Version Control or how to Clone Repositories, how to Fork, make Pull Requests, and Merge Repositories and a whole bunch of really, really exciting things. So let's talk about Version Control in its simplest form. Let's say that I create a new code file and I write a few lines in it. Now I decide to put it under version control using Git and let's say that I call this save point number one. Now this is my first version, so later on as I progress I write maybe a few more lines of code. And at this point I decide to make another save point and I call this my second version. Further down the line, I accidentally screw up my entire code file and it's irreparable, and I get to the point where I would rather burn my entire code file rather than having to try and fix it. You do get into these situations because very often your code is interlinked and each class depends on another, and sometimes you can screw up in a way where you know all hope is lost, and I simply just want to roll back to the last save point. I can do that using Git. You can either compare your current code file, so the current mess that you've made, against a previous version, so at any of the save points before. Alternatively, you can simply just roll back to a previous version, and it doesn't have to be the one that was immediately previous. You can go as far back or as far forwards as you like, as long as you know which version you want. In the next lesson, I'm going to show you Version Control using Git locally on your computer, and we're going to use the command line to do this. So I'll see you there. Now, the first thing we're going to do is open up Terminal and inside terminal, we're going to navigate to our desktop. So if you're not familiar with the command line and you haven't watched the module on the command line, then I recommend you to take a look at it now because we're going to be using a lot of the commands to create directories and navigate around. So if you're not yet familiar, then it's a good time to take a look at that. The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to cd into my desktop, and here I'm going to create a new directory called Story. Then I'm going to cd into this Story directory. And if I show you with ls, you can see that it's completely empty. And similarly, inside Finder, I can show you the same thing. Let's go ahead and create some text files. I'm going to use, touch, to create a file called chapter1.txt, and then I'm going to open chapter1.txt So let's go ahead and open chapter1 and let's write something inside, shall we? Okay, so there's my masterpiece done. I'm going to go ahead and hit Save and I'm going to quit. So that was our first chapter, done. Now let's create a Git local repository and start tracking some of these file changes. To initialize git we simply write \"git init\". And as you can see, it's initialized an empty git repository inside the Story directory. Now if you have a look inside finder you actually can't see this dot git at all. But as we learned before, if you use, ls -a, you can see all the hidden files and you can see that .git is right there and it's going to be used to track all your changes, to commit your changes and to perform version control. So we're currently inside the Story directory and you can also call this the Working directory. So as I mentioned before, using Git and learning about version control, it comes with some of its own terminology and language. So I'm going to try and simplify a lot of these terms that you'll come across just so that we can all be on the same page and we all understand what's going on. Currently, we are inside the working directory, which is the Story directory, and here, in order to start tracking the changes of my files, for example, chapter1.txt, then I need to add this file to what's called a Staging Area. And that is basically an intermediate place where you can pick and choose which files inside your working directory that you want to commit. So to see what's currently inside your staging area, you can use the \"git status\" command, and it shows you that there are untracked files which will be shown in red. And this is something that's simply inside your working directory, but it's not yet in the staging Area. In order to add it to the staging area and to start tracking changes in it, then we have to use the command, \"git add\". We're going to type, git add, and we're going to type the file name, so in this case it's chapter 1.txt. So go ahead and hit Enter. And then if we try using \"git status\" again, you can see that that file has been added as a new file and it is now green. So this is now in the staging area and it's ready to be committed. So let's go ahead and commit this under version control. So the command is \"git commit\" and I'm going to use the \"-m\" flag to add a commit message. The commit message is really, really important. It's something that helps you keep track of what changes you have made in each commit. So when you create a new save point, you want to be as explicit as possible about what changes were made between the last save point and this current save point. For our initial commit, we can use something very simple like, \"Initial commit,\" and this shows that this is our starting point. Alternatively, if you want to be slightly more specific, because in our case we've actually completed chapter1, so you can write, \"Complete chapter 1\". Now, the thing that you'll realize is that usually with commit messages, they are written in the present tense and this is the best practice. So whereas it would probably make more sense, I guess, at least in my head anyways, to write completed chapter1 as this save point, it's actually by convention that you should always use the present tense. So it's like you're submitting your changes now. Let's go ahead and hit Enter to make our first commit and you can see what commits you have made by using the, \"git log\" command. You can see that this commit was made at this time by this person. And it also has a hash, and this hash uniquely identifies this particular commit. And then right at the end, you see this commit message of what this save point was all about. So now I'm going to go ahead and create two more chapters. So let's just create a chapter2.txt  and chapter3.txt. And now we have three chapters and I'm going to go in and change some of these text files. So let's say. Okay, so that's chapter2 done. And finally, let's go ahead and just open chapter3 and edit that as well. All right. So all three files have been changed. And over here in Finder, you can actually get a quick peek at what the contents are, which is going to be really useful for me to be able to demonstrate to you what Git is doing behind the background. So now let's go ahead and add these two new files to our staging area. So again, if we use \"git status\", you can see that there's two files that are untracked, which are only in the working directory and not yet inside the staging area. So we can put it into the staging area by simply adding each of them as we did before, git add, and writing something like chapter2.txt and then doing, git add, chapte3.txt. But as you can imagine, if you have quite a few files, then it can get incredibly tedious having to do this one by one. So of course there is a better way. Instead of adding these files one by one, we can actually simply just say, \"git add  .\", and then use the dot (.) to specify everything inside this current directory. So everything inside the story directory. Now if I go ahead and hit enter and then let's go to, git status again, you can see that there's two new files that have been added to the staging area and now we're going to commit those two files to a new commit to a new save point. And you know what to do. If you're following along with me, go ahead and give it a go. All right. So how was that? If you remember, the command is, git commit, and we're going to use the, -m flag, to specify a commit message and we're going to write a message that is in the present tense. So let's say complete chapter 2 and 3. So that's everything I've done between the initial commit and this commit, the only difference is the fact that I've completed now chapter 2 and chapter 3. So let's go ahead and hit Enter. Again, let's check it out using, \"git log\". We can see that we now have two commits, both with different hashes because they are unique and they are different. The initial one was Complete chapter 1 and it was done at this time. And then later on, about five minutes later, I completed chapter 2 and 3 and that was the second commit. And this is where we are at right now. So you can see by this word \"HEAD\", this is the position or the current state that we are in. So I just want to quickly recap what we've just done. We created a file in our working directory inside our story directory. So the working directory is the folder or the directory where you initialize your git repository. When we said \"git init,\" we did that inside the Story directory. So that becomes our working directory and from now on Git is going to try and track the changes that it sees between the working directory and the local repository. In the beginning, we created a file inside our working directory inside story and then we used, git add, to push it to the staging area. Now the reason why there is this intermediate staging area because you might wonder why not just go from the working directory straight to the repository? Why do we need this extra step? Well, sometimes you might not want to add all of your files to be tracked or all of your files to be committed. So the staging area is a good place to try and figure out what are the things that you want Git to ignore and, what are the things that you want to be tracked? Once we've used, \"git add\", we've put our file into the staging area and we're happy with the changes that we are going to commit. Then the next step is to go ahead and commit it using the \"git commit\" command. So now our file is inside our local repository and that version is given a name through the commit message. So that means that even if we've messed up our file, we can still use the last version that's under version control and we can use a special command called, \"git checkout\", to revert back or roll back to the last position in our local repository. Let me show you what that looks like in the command line and how we would do that in practice. At the moment I've got three nicely written chapters and I have a feeling that my book is going to be a big seller. Now let's say that I have, you know, been working on chapter3 and I have completely messed everything up. I'm just, you know, fell asleep on my keyboard and I happen to have saved my file. And now if you have a look at it, it's now just mumbo jumbo. And I've ruined my masterpiece. But fear not, because we have version control and we have Git enabled so we have nothing to worry about. I can actually revert the changes that I've made locally in my working directory. So at this point, you can use \"git status\" to see that we have modifications in our chapter3.txt file that have not yet been committed or added to the staging area. So if we wanted to, we can actually revert this back to its previous glory. But before we do that, we can use a Git command to check out what are the differences between the current version of chapter 3 and the last save point in our Git repository? To do that, you can use the command, \"git diff\". So the difference, and we'll give it the chapter 3file name. And if you hit Enter, you can see that this is the part that was deleted, so the part in red, and then this was the part that was added, which is our gobbledygook. So now if I've looked at these differences, it might just be that, you know, there's only a few mistakes in my new version of chapter3, and I just want to maybe copy some things over or have a look at how I did certain things previously, and change my current file. But other times it might be that, you know, it's just you want to torch the new file, you just don't want anything to do with it and you would much rather roll back to the previous version. So if you want to do that, then there is a command called, \"git checkout\" that is going to be really, really useful for you. So, git checkout, and then we're going to specify the name of the file that we want to check out, which is chapter3.txt. And if you just watch over here, which is the preview of the current version of chapter3.txt, once I hit Enter on this command that basically asks to roll back this chapter three to the last version that was committed in our local repository. So if I hit Enter, you can see that almost immediately my chapter3 has been restored to its previous glorious state, and this is the version of chapter3 at the last checkpoint at which I committed it. So that was this one, which is completed chapter 2 and 3. Whereas in this lesson we've looked mostly at local implementations of Git, so saving these versions on our computer locally, in the next lesson, I'm going to talk about GitHub and creating remote repositories. So I'll see you there. All right. So whereas in the last lesson, we were looking at local implementations of using Git and Version Control, in this lesson, we're going to talk about how you can create a Remote Repository. So a repository that's hosted on somebody else's server or somebody else's computer by using GitHub. Now, most people would have heard of GitHub and certainly by now you would have used GitHub many times. So if you haven't yet set up an account on GitHub, then this is the time to do it. So head over to github.com and simply fill out this quick form to create an account on GitHub. It's completely free, and all you need to do is just confirm your email so that you can access it. Once you've done that, go ahead and sign in. Once you've signed in, you should be looking at this page. And what we're going to do is we're going to create a repository inside the browser-based GitHub. So if you navigate to this top right corner and click that plus arrow (+), then you can select New repository and I'm going to call my repository, same name, I guess we'll call it, \"Story\" and let's give it a description. Let's say, \"My masterpiece.\" Now, by default, all repositories that you create on GitHub are Public. That means that anyone can see all of the files inside your saved repository. So everything that you commit to your remote repository or to your GitHub repository will be public. If you don't want that, then you can select Private, but in most cases, if you're not doing anything that's top secret, or if you're not developing technology that is completely brand new, then having a public repository is not such a big problem. And on the other hand as well, you can see loads of other people's public repositories and you can see, for example, how they structure their code, what is their style, and you can see how people do things. For example, on GitHub, there are whole repositories on things like flappy bird. So it's the entire implementation of flappy bird and you can run it or you can also look through their code base to see how they did this. This is the beauty of open-source code, and as you develop in your journey of becoming a developer, then you might find that you want to contribute to other open source projects, help them out a bit and work in a virtual team to try and contribute your knowledge and your programming skills. Okay, so once I've selected public, the next thing is that I'm going to leave this part empty. I'm not going to initialize a README for my repository just yet. The next thing is that I'm going to go ahead and click the big green button and create my repository. Now, you can see that there are two ways that they tell you, you can set up your repository. You can either set it up in GitHub on desktop, their desktop client, which I am not a big fan of, but instead what we're going to do is we're going to use the command line instructions to set up our repository. So we are going to push an existing repository that we've got locally onto this remote repository. And to do that we need to copy the address of our GitHub repository and we're going to use these two lines of code in order to transfer or push our existing local repository from the command line. All right. I'm currently inside my Story directory, which also happens to be the Working directory for this particular project. And here I am going to again take a look at \"git log\" to see what previous commits we've got. And you can see that we've got two previous commits and I would like to push both of these commits onto GitHub. To do that, the first thing is creating a Remote. So it's telling my Local Git Repository that I've created a Remote Repository somewhere on the internet and I want to transfer all of my commits over there. So the command that we're going to use is, \"git remote add origin\". Now, origin is simply the name of your remote and you can theoretically call it anything you want. You can call it bacon if you want, but by convention and it's highly recommended that you simply keep the name origin. And the reason is because most programmers are used to the conventional naming, and that means it will be much easier for them to understand what's going on in your project when they have a look at it, instead of you doing something completely different, which will be very surprising and it'll be a lot harder for people to understand what's going on. So, \"git remote add origin\", and then we're going to paste the URL of our remote repository on GitHub, and then we're going to go ahead and hit Enter. And now that remote is created, so we can push our local repository onto our Remote Repository, which is called origin. So we're going to say, \"git push -u origin main\". And what this line of code does is that it pushes your local repository to the remote repository using the u flag or the u option, which basically links up your remote and your local repositories. And then we're going to push it towards the remote that's called origin, and we're going to push it to the branch that's called main. The main branch is simply the default branch or the main branch of all of your commits. And later on when we cover branching, then we're going to talk more about what is a main and what is a branch. But for now, we're just saying that we're going to push our local repository onto this origin remote and we're going to push it to the main branch. So let's go ahead and hit Enter. And there's going to be a little bit of work being done in the background, because it's actually going to have to upload your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub servers, and depending on the size of your local repository, this can take various amounts of time. Now, once we see our prompt, so the flashing cursor, or the dollar sign, that means that our push is successful, and as you can see, it says, \"branch main set up to track remote branch main from origin.\" Sounds really confusing, but if you head back over to GitHub and if you're on the same page, all you have to do is hit command R to refresh or just press the refresh button and you can see that all of our files are now hosted on GitHub and it's complete with all of our commit messages. So if you go into Insights, and go into Network, you can actually see our main branch, which currently only has two save points or two commits. And if you hover over them, you can actually see the commit messages of each of these. As you build out your project, as you add more commits either locally or pushing it remotely or probably doing both, then you can see the progress of your files in your GitHub repository. So now you can see all of the code, if it's code file, or in our case, it's just a text file hosted on GitHub and you can point anybody towards this. And there are actually cases where people do a lot of story writing using GitHub just because it's so good at tracking your save points and being able to revert to previous versions in the past. So for example, if you head over back to the main page and you go to your commits, you can see both of those commits when they were committed, and also if you click on it, you can see the changes that were made at those time points. So if we have a look at chapter 1, you can see this is all we had at the point when we made our first commit. Previously, we said that we have a Working directory, which is the directory where we initialized git. Then we can push our files to a Staging area where we can pick and choose which files we want to commit. Then once we're ready, then we can commit our files or our save point to our Local repository. So once you've done a few commits, then you actually have this timeline of various commits and this is called your Main Branch. So the main branch is your main branch of commits or save points, and it is sequential, and this is usually where your main progress is saved or committed. Later on, we then introduced this idea of the Remote Repository. The important thing to note is that you can have a local repository completely in parallel with a remote repository check the differences between them, but you can also sync them or push things from your local repository to your remote repository. So in our case, the local repository is the git file that we've got inside our Story directory, and the remote repository is GitHub, which hosts our code and also hosts all of the changes that were made in between the different commits. So we have this main branch of various commits; first commit, second commit, third commit in our local git repository, and when we performed the command \"git push\", then that effectively pushed all of those commits, all of those various versions and changes, and code pieces to our remote repository on GitHub. So that's what \"git push\" does. Now in the next lesson, I want to talk about using \".gitignore\" and how you can avoid uploading sensitive pieces of information such as API Keys or Passwords to your remote repositories for example, GitHub. So all of that and more on the next lesson. See you there. All right guys, in this lesson, we're going to be talking all about the .gitignore, and how you can set rules to prevent committing certain files to your local and remote Git repositories. So first things first, let's bring up terminal. And what we're going to do is we're going to cd into our desktop, and we're going to create a new directory here called Project. Just say that we have this brand new project. And now if we go into our project, and we create a whole bunch of files to simulate this example project. So let's say we've got something called file1.txt, and we've got a whole bunch of other ones, file2, file3, and we've also got something called secrets file. So we've now got four files, and just to illustrate the use cases of when we might want to have a .gitignore file, so say if you have this file that has some, you know, secret passwords or API keys, basically stuff that you don't want to be committed, especially you don't want it to be hosted on an open platform like GitHub. There have been horror stories of people having their Amazon AWS secret keys in their projects and that getting pushed to their remote on GitHub, and within seconds, their entire AWS account has been, basically, used up and wiped clean. So it's really, really important to think about some of these things and to be aware of what you are putting onto this public platform. Another type of file that you might want to add into a .gitignore, or you might want to not upload to GitHub are files that are to do with your local settings or your user preferences. And there's a whole bunch of these types of utility files that you don't really want another person to have to download and copy into their project folder if they're cloning or if they're forking your project. So a really common example that people tend to add to their .gitignore files are what are called .DS_Store files. .DS_Store files are basically a settings file that saves a certain things like, you know, how you like your icons to be arranged in a particular project folder. So let's say if we go in here, and we just have a look at arranged by, arranged by none, and then I'm going to move my files around, and let's say that this is just my preference for how I want my files to be shown inside this project folder. Now, the .DS_Store file is a hidden file, so you won't be able to see it inside your finder, but, of course, we as command line experts (chuckles) know that we can simply do a ls -a to see all of the hidden files that are inside our project folder. And you can see there it is, .DS_Store. So that's not something that's going to be of any use to anybody else, and we don't want to have to clutter our GitHub remote repository or anybody else's computer with that file. So we're going to add that to our .gitignore as well. Getting onto the point of creating and using a .gitignore file, the first thing you have to do is to make it, right? And to do that we're just going to create a hidden file. So using the dot in front of the file name, and it's going to be called .gitignore. Now the case and the wording matters a huge deal, because we're using Git and it's looking for this specific file. So make sure that when you're using it, it looks exactly like this. Let's create that file. And of course it doesn't appear, because it's a hidden file, but we can see it using ls -a, and we can also open it inside VS Code like this. Here is where we add the files that should be ignored when we commit our project to Git. Let me first show you what happens when we don't have anything inside our .gitignore. And I'm going to go through the normal process of setting up Git and committing it. First, if you remember, I have to use git init to initialize an empty Git repository inside my projects directory. And then I'm going to use git add . to add all the files that are currently inside this directory to the Git staging area. So hit Enter, and we can have a look at what's been added by using git status. And you can see that all of these files are added into the staging area, and they're going to be committed if I go ahead and do git commit. So that's not what we want. And instead, I don't want to commit the .DS_Store and I also don't want to commit my secrets.txt file. First things first, I'm going to basically undo what I've just done. So I'm going to remove all of these files from my staging area, and then I'm going to add them later on once I've got my .gitignore set up. Basically we're just undoing the last step. To do that, I'm going to write, git rm --cached, and I'm going to use the -r flag for recursive, and I'm going to use a dot to say that everything inside the current directory should be removed from the staging area. So now if I hit Enter, you can see that all of these things have been removed from the Git staging area, and if I do a git status again, you can see that all of these files are no longer tracked to be committed. So now this is the point where we're going to use that .gitignore file, and we're going to add the file names that we want to be ignored when we're adding and committing to Git. In order to add individual files, you can simply specify the file name on each and every new line. So, for example, if we want to ignore the .DS_Store, we can simply write .DS_Store. So exactly the same upper and lower casing as the name of the file. And if we wanted to ignore the secrets.txt file, then all we have to do is just to specify it in here on a new line. Now with .gitignore it has certain rules. So, for example, you can use the pound sign (#) to comment. So, for example, you can say, you know, \"#Log files\", right? To be ignored. Another thing you can do is use wild cards. So if you use the asterisk (*) and you say, *.txt, that means that when you commit your project, all of the files that have a text extension will be ignored. All right, so I'm going to get rid of that, because I do want to commit the file1 and file2 and file3 to Git, but I want it to ignore the .DS_Store and the secrets.txt files. Now we're ready to add our files to our staging area. So let's again use git add . and use git status to see what's been added. So you can see that the only files are added are the .gitignore, the file 1, 2, 3, but the .DS_Store, as well as, the secrets.txt are ignored as per the specifications in our .gitignore file. Now if I go ahead and commit this as my \"Initial commit\", then the only files are going to be put onto my local commit are going to be these four. And similarly, if I push this to GitHub, it will also be only these four files. Now let's open a new Flask project and let me show you how you would add a .gitignore file for your Python projects. So let's just call this Test, and I'm going to put it inside my desktop. So after I open the project, I'm going to create a new virtual environment. And I'm going to install all the modules from the requirements.txt file, then I'm going to open the terminal and create a .gitignore file. Then we're going to open our .gitignore, and in here I'm going to add some of the files that will be ignored for our Python project. If you go to github.com/github, so this is a repository owned by the GitHub team, they have a repository called gitignore, and it's basically a pre-made collection of useful .gitignore templates. And if you have a search in here, you can find that you've got Python, and you're going to see that this is a prebuilt template for some of the files that you probably won't want to upload to GitHub or any other remote repository. So these have the file extensions for things that are virtual environments or environment settings, and it's basically all pre-made for you. So you can simply just copy all of this and put it into your .gitignore file that you created earlier on. So just straight up paste. And if you remember from earlier on, we said that the lines that start off with a pound sign are the comments, and these ones are extensions that you would ignore. And you might want to add things like .DS_store into here as well. So you can have something like # Project-wide. So for example, the .DS_Store that we mentioned earlier on, and if you hit Save... Now, if we go into terminal, and we're inside our test folder, so we're going to do a git init, git add ., git status to see what's going to be committed. And then we're going to say, git commit -m \"Initial commit\". There we go, and now, once you're ready to commit and add all of this to your remote, then it will ignore all of these common user-related files that are not going to be useful to your collaborators or anybody who wants to contribute on GitHub. That was just a quick tidbit about using .gitignore, and I know that some of you guys have been asking about, you know, where should you put your API keys, where should you put your sensitive data? And you have to make sure that when you are uploading your projects with these secret keys and passwords, to make sure that you set up a .gitignore file, and to include those things in there. All right, so that's all for this lesson. In the next lesson I want to talk about Git Clone, and how to clone various repositories to your local system. So for all of that and more in the next lesson. So I'll see you there. In the last lesson, we looked at how we can push our Local Repository to a Remote Repository on GitHub. Now, in this lesson, I want to talk about cloning a Remote Repository on GitHub to pull it onto your Local Repository on your machine. So this is called cloning, and the command is git clone. And this is a way for you to pull down all of the versions and all of the commits of a particular remote repository, and to store the files in your own working directory. So once you've cloned a repo, you've essentially made a copy of it on your own local working environment, and it allows you to stand on the shoulder of giants and continue where they left off. So you won't need to clone it again during regular development, you'll continue on your own branch of that project. So why would you need to clone someone else's project? Well, it's basically so that you can have your own copy of a program that they wrote. Maybe you want to customize it to your own needs. Maybe the program needs to do something it currently doesn't do, and you want to extend its functionality. Or maybe you just found a bug and you want to fix it. So essentially, it allows you to leverage somebody else's open source code, so they're putting their source code out onto the internet and you can simply make a copy of it, and continue where they left off. For example, a lot of people use self-hosted applications for their business. These are free versions of projects and services you might have to normally pay for, such as productivity and project management tools that are alternative to Jira or Trello or email servers like MailChimp. Instead of having to pay Mailchimp a ton of money, you can host your own email servers, or time tracking software for freelancers. And there's a ton, a ton, literal ton of different options and you can take a look through that in this GitHub README. Let's see how it works in practice. Let's clone some actual repo's from GitHub and run them locally to see how the entire process works. The command is pretty simple. It's simply git space clone space the url (git clone url). But the url will typically be from GitHub and it will look something like this. So what are we going to clone? Well, did you know that you can run the original Quake video game in your web browser? It's entirely built in JavaScript, so there'll be parts of it that you'll be able to read through, and you'll be able to understand. But there'll be a lot of work that's done to create this game. So thankfully, we don't have to build it from scratch. All we have to do is just to git clone. I go ahead, I grab the url to clone the repository, and in my terminal I can write git clone and paste in that url. Now, once it receives all of the objects, and it gets loaded onto my own computer, then I can go ahead and cd into the repository, quakejs. And once I'm inside that repository, I can install all of the NPM packages by running \"npm install\". And then the next step as they describe in the documentation is I need to set the content .quake.js.com as the content server. So I'm just going to simply copy this entire line of commands and paste it into my terminal. Now, once I'm done, I can simply run the server using Node by again pasting this line of commands. And once it starts, you can see that, \"web server is now listening on port :::8080\". And so now I can go to that port and check out the Quakejs game. So making sure that your url is the same as the one that they have set in their documentation, go ahead and agree, and you'll see once everything's loaded up, the original Quake game running on your browser. But more importantly, you are running it from the code that you cloned from GitHub. So feel free to have a play around with the game. It's pretty cool and it's very retro. And there you have it. Now another example is Wordle. Wordle is basically a word game where you have to guess a five letter word using just six tries, and it went completely viral a few years ago, and eventually got bought by the New York Times. And the official Wordle is now accessed at the New York Times alongside all of their different crosswords and puzzles. But somebody has created all the code for Wordle, and we can clone it and run it on our own system. So again, grabbing hold of the URL at the GitHub repository, you can see it's entirely created in Python and uses Tkinter. So all the things that we know about, we can head back to our terminal, use git clone to clone from that url, and then we open the folder and set up our virtual Python environment. And the reason why they created it is because the original game only allows you to play one word per day, but what if you get entirely addicted to Wordle and you want to play more than one word per day? Well, you're in luck because you know how to clone the program and run it on your own system. Now all we have to do is just to install all of the required modules, and once that's done, we can click on play and the game will start in a separate window. Go ahead, have a guess, see what you have. And my personal starting word, top secret is usually, NOTES or another word with R and T and S. But have fun playing with that. And you can dig through the code, you can change it from Wordle game to anything else you want to call it. Or you can change the colors. You can modify the code base, because you now own it on your own computer, and you can run it, and you can modify it. And you can see just how cool it is to be able to simply clone somebody else's entire code base that they've made open source for you to continue developing on it. So look through the code, open it up, and take a look inside the word files to see all of the available words. There's no cheating here. And you'll be able to see the actual code that makes this game run. So you can see it's just simple Python which you know all about. And some of these things you might not understand. But through studying somebody else's code and modifying it, it usually makes you a much better developer. Go ahead, try to improve your own version, make it a 2.0 Wordle, whatever that means to you. And this is a big part of your developer journey. One of the best ways to improve your programming skills is to read other people's code to understand what their code is doing, and most importantly, try to modify it just a little bit at the beginning and maybe a lot more in the future. But it gives you a way to level up your skillset by building on top of somebody else's work. And open-source code is a great way to get started. You can clone somebody's repository, take a look at some of the more interesting ones that we've listed here such as Wordle or Jarvis. See roughly how things work and see if there are just small things that you might want to change about it. And this will lead you onto a very important step on your developer journey, which is contributing to open source code. Now, there's a lot of projects, there's even a list of projects on GitHub where they have curated some projects which are particularly welcoming to first time contributors. So teams which are open for first timers or beginners to contribute. And you can take a look at that by going to awesome-for-beginners, this particular repository, and take a look through the README. Take a look at maybe the pandas module or take a look at Jarvis or Matplotlib. You can contribute to all of these, but in order to know how to make a contribution, you need to learn about pull requests, branches, and merging which is exactly what we'll cover in the upcoming lessons. So for all of that and more, I'll see you there. Now, in the last lesson, we spoke about some of the more basic variants of version control. In this lesson, I want to talk about Branches and Branching. Now let's start off with a simple example, say if we had Version 1 and 2, so two commits that were made to our local repository, and at this point, we realize that we want to maybe try out something different, maybe build a new feature, or just to mess around with a new idea or concept. What we can do is instead of continuing to commit to the main branch that you see here, we can also create a side branch. After the second commit, we create a new branch and we start committing to this new branch or this experimental branch. We add some features and we write some code. Simultaneously, we can continue working on the main branch, putting out all those essential updates or bits of code that are maintaining our main project, but at the same time we can continue to update and work on this experimental branch trying things out and committing our experiments to this experimental branch. So now we have two branches that are parallel to each other and they can be developed simultaneously. If at some point in the future that we decide that that experiment was really fruitful, and the feature that we built in it was really, really great and we'd like to merge it back to the main branch or to the main project, then that can be done really easily as well by simply placing a merge request in. And we can bring all of those changes that we experimented with, that we messed around with, back to the main project and check to see if there's any conflict with the main branch code and if not, or if after a little bit of editing, then we can bring all of those changes into the main working branch. And then we can continue working from here onto to the next commit or we can make more branches. And very often what you see in practice is that there'll be multiple branches being worked on at the same time for any given large project. And the reason is because sometimes you're developing new features, sometimes you are fixing bugs and all of these things may break your main project, so you don't want to do it on the main branch. You only want to put it onto the main branch once you know that everything is working fine, and then you can bring your code back to the working copy ready for shipment and deployment. Let's take a look at how this would work in reality. Now let's say we navigate back to our Story directory, and inside here we've still got our previous three chapters and they are under version control. So if we just have a look at \"git log\", you can see that this is currently the most recent commit and it's also mirrored in our remote. Let's try and do this locally first. If I decided that I want to create a new branch, you can simply just write \"git branch\" and specify the name of your new branch. I'm going to add a space-related plot to my story, so let's call our branch, \"alien-plot.\" Hit Enter. And now you can check out what branches you have by just writing \"git branch\" without the name and you can see that you've got one branch called, alien-plot and another one called main, and the asterisks (*) shows you which branch you are currently on. So we're currently on the main branch. We can switch to the alien-plot by simply writing \"git checkout alien-plot\". Okay. As it says, we have now switched to the branch called, alien-plot. Now, it is inside this branch that I'm going to make some changes to my chapters. Now I'm going to make some completely nonsensical modification to my files. So let's change chapter 1. Let's change chapter2. Okay. There we go. Okay, so we've made some modifications to chapter1 and chapter2, and we've decided to change some of the pre-existing written text to integrate a space-themed or alien-themed plot. Let's go ahead and commit that. So remember, we have to do \"git add .\" and then \"git commit -m...\" and our message is going to be \"modify chapter 1 and 2 to have alien theme\". Okay, now hit Enter and we've made our commits. Now if we do a \"git log\", we can see that we have two commits made on the main branch and we have one commit made on the alien plot-branch. So now let's say that we go back onto our main branch. Whenever you're confused where you are, you can always do a \"git branch\" to check and see where the asterisks is. And the asterisks is obviously where you are. So let's do a \"git checkout main\" to go back to the main branch. So you can see that our main branch is unchanged with respect to the space or alien plot that we did just now. Nothing has changed over here. So while on the main branch, I'm going to create a new file, I'm going to call it chapter4.txt. And inside chapter four, let's add something. Okay. And hit, Enter and Save. By the way, I have no idea what I'm typing. I'm now making up and destroying, probably in the process a masterpiece, but it's okay. So we now have a chapter4 on our main branch and I'm going to go ahead and do a \"git add .\" and \"git commit\". Now there's ways of combining add and commit together in the same command, but I think if you're new to git, it's always good to really know in your head exactly what's going on. So I recommend actually separating those two bits out. Let's go ahead and give it a commit message. \"add chapter 4.\" Okay, so \"git log\". Let's see, what have we got? We are currently only looking at the main branch and we have three commits. This is the position of our remote. So on our GitHub repository, this was the latest commit that it could see. But on our local git repository, this is in fact the latest commit, the one that we just made where we added chapter4. And you can see that if I switch between the branches, say, if I go over to alien-plot branch and hit Enter, you can see that our local files actually changed as I switched branches. Let's just say that I'm quite happy with the changes that I've made in terms of my alien-plot addition and I would like to merge these changes back into my main branch. So I've done a little bit of experimentation on a separate branch, I've, you know, messed with a few things and I think it was a great experiment. So I'm going to put it back into our main branch. In order to do that, what you have to do is go back to the main branch. So \"git checkout main\" and while we're on the main branch we're going to merge the changes inside the alien-plot branch. So we use the command \"git merge\" and we're going to specify the branch name which was, \"alien-plot\" hit Enter. And this opens up Vim, which is a text editor, and this allows you to add a merge message if you wish. And alternatively, as we're going to do here, we're just going to leave it empty and you're going to write, \":",
      "while on the main branch, I'm going to create a new file, I'm going to call it chapter4.txt. And inside chapter four, let's add something. Okay. And hit, Enter and Save. By the way, I have no idea what I'm typing. I'm now making up and destroying, probably in the process a masterpiece, but it's okay.

But SQLite is a <strong>file-based database</strong>. </p><p>This is its strength and weakness. It's a strength because while we're coding up our database and debugging, it's really useful to be able to open the SQLite file using DB&nbsp;Viewer and see how our data looks.</p><figure><img src=\"./8. 2020-10-27_15-13-03-2e5d6a8a93057612885b4389439e16bd.png\"></figure><p>But it's also a weakness because once it's deployed with a hosting provider (like Heroku or Render) the file locations are shifted around every 24 hours or so.

That will mean some very unhappy users. <a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sqlite3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">(Heroku explainer here).</a></p><p>So we've got to put on our big-boy/big-girl pants and upgrade our simple SQLite database to <strong>PosgreSQL</strong>, a database that can handle millions of data entries and reliably delivers data to users.</p><p>Luckily, because we used SQLAlchemy to create our Flask app, there's nothing we need to change in terms of code.

Each data point is divided by the total searches of the geography and time range it represents to compare relative popularity. </p><p><br></p><p>For each word in your search, Google finds how much search volume in each region and time period your term had relative to all the searches in that region and time period.

We can show them using the <code>.duplicated()</code> method, which brings up 476 rows:</p><p><br></p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">duplicated_rows = df_apps_clean[df_apps_clean.duplicated()]\nprint(duplicated_rows.shape)\nduplicated_rows.head()</pre><p><br></p><p>We can actually check for an individual app like \u2018Instagram\u2019 by looking up all the entries with that name in the App column.</p><figure><img src=\"./2. 2020-10-10_11-47-31-8c3f03dbcb7dd1fe7d38c6cc96a69a9a.png\"></figure><p>So how do we get rid of duplicates? Can we simply call <code>.drop_duplicates()</code>?</p><p><br></p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">df_apps_clean = df_apps_clean.drop_duplicates()</pre><p>Not really. If we do this without specifying how to identify duplicates, we see that 3 copies of Instagram are retained because they have a different number of reviews. We need to provide the column names that should be used in the comparison to identify duplicates. For example:</p><figure><img src=\"./2. 2020-10-10_11-47-48-eb3f1b28243622d449e0958bc57ad4a5.png\"></figure><p>This leaves us with 8,199 entries after removing duplicates. Huzzah! \ud83d\udcaa</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What else should I know about the data?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>So we can see that 13 different features were originally scraped from the Google Play Store.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Obviously, the data is just a sample out of all the Android apps. It doesn't include all Android apps of which there are millions.</p></li><li><p>I\u2019ll assume that the sample is representative of the App Store as a whole. This is not necessarily the case as, during the web scraping process, this sample was served up based on geographical location and user behaviour of the person who scraped it - in our case Lavanya Gupta.</p></li><li><p>The data was compiled around 2017/2018. The pricing data reflect the price in USD Dollars at the time of scraping. (developers can offer promotions and change their app\u2019s pricing).</p></li><li><p>I\u2019ve converted the app\u2019s size to a floating-point number in MBs. If data was missing, it has been replaced by the average size for that category.</p></li><li><p>The installs are not the exact number of installs. If an app has 245,239 installs then Google will simply report an order of magnitude like 100,000+. I\u2019ve removed the '+' and we\u2019ll assume the exact number of installs in that column for simplicity.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Here\u2019s what you would see under an Android app listing if you go to a listing on the Google Play Store:</p><figure><img src=\"./2. 2020-10-10_11-48-11-f6ba2e6e8c46047d93a8c2d1baaa68d1.png\"></figure><figure><img src=\"./2. 2020-10-10_11-48-18-97ccd1a03fd69d43ea1a1635e1e521d8.png\"></figure><p><br></p><p><br></p></body></html>"

That way, even if it\u2019s more difficult to discover among all the other apps, your app has a better chance of getting installed, right? Let\u2019s analyse this with bar charts and scatter plots and figure out which categories are dominating the market.</p><p><br></p><p>We can find the number of different categories like so:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">df_apps_clean.Category.nunique()</pre><p>Which shows us that we there are 33 unique categories.</p><p><br></p><p>To calculate the number of apps per category we can use our old friend <code>.value_counts()</code></p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">top10_category = df_apps_clean.Category.value_counts()[:10]</pre><figure><img src=\"./6. 2020-10-11_12-50-03-484dad1e2ae6699a90c68800f1a24ca9.png\"></figure><p>To visualise this data in a bar chart we can use the plotly express (our px) <a href=\"https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.express.bar.html#plotly.express.bar\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bar()</a> function:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">bar = px.bar(x = top10_category.index, # index = category name\n             y = top10_category.values)\n\nbar.show()</pre><figure><img src=\"./6. 2020-10-11_12-50-27-18f0bf39f584e83d11de5a269b080336.png\"></figure><p>Based on the number of apps, the Family and Game categories are the most competitive. Releasing yet another app into these categories will make it hard to get noticed.</p><p><br></p><p>But what if we look at it from a different perspective? What matters is not just the total number of apps in the category but how often apps are downloaded in that category. This will give us an idea of how popular a category is. First, we have to group all our apps by category and sum the number of installations:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">category_installs = df_apps_clean.groupby('Category').agg({'Installs': pd.Series.sum})\ncategory_installs.sort_values('Installs', ascending=True, inplace=True)</pre><p>Then we can create a horizontal bar chart, simply by adding the orientation parameter:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">h_bar = px.bar(x = category_installs.Installs,\n               y = category_installs.index,\n               orientation='h')\n\nh_bar.show()</pre><p>We can also add a custom title and axis labels like so:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">h_bar = px.bar(x = category_installs.Installs,\n               y = category_installs.index,\n               orientation='h',\n               title='Category Popularity')\n\nh_bar.update_layout(xaxis_title='Number of Downloads', yaxis_title='Category')\nh_bar.show()</pre><figure><img src=\"./6. 2020-10-11_12-51-08-abc65eebc2434504dd6457da4618a9ac.png\"></figure><p>Now we see that Games and Tools are actually the most popular categories. If we plot the popularity of a category next to the number of apps in that category we can get an idea of how concentrated a category is. Do few apps have most of the downloads or are the downloads spread out over many apps?</p><h4>Challenge</h4><p>As a challenge, let\u2019s use plotly to create a scatter plot that looks like this:</p><figure><img src=\"./6. 2020-10-11_12-51-37-3937d6162a4800714f6fdcbdf2b12870.png\"></figure><ul><li><p>Create a DataFrame that has the number of apps in one column and the number of installs in another:</p></li></ul><figure><img height=\"432\" src=\"./6. 2020-10-11_13-13-37-047a427b6b3dffb981c19c580f398673.png\" width=\"617\"></figure><ul><li><p>Then use the <a href=\"https://plotly.com/python/line-and-scatter/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plotly express examples from the documentation</a> alongside the <a href=\"https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.express.scatter.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">.scatter() API reference</a> to create scatter plot that looks like the chart above.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><em>Hint</em>: Use the <code>size</code>, <code>hover_name</code> and <code>color</code> parameters in <code>.scatter()</code>.

So if any of this was unclear or confusing. Pause on this lesson for a minute and play around with the array above. Try selecting different subsets from the array.

This means that NumPy will treat vectors, matrices and tensors in a way that a mathematician would expect. For example, if you had two vectors: </p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">v1 = np.array([4, 5, 2, 7])\nv2 = np.array([2, 1, 3, 3])</pre><p>And you add them together</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">v1 + v2</pre><p>The result will be a ndarray where all the elements have been added together. </p><p><code>array([ 6, 6, 5, 10])</code></p><p>In contrast, if we had two Python Lists</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">list1 = [4, 5, 2, 7]\nlist2 = [2, 1, 3, 3]</pre><p>adding them together would just concatenate the lists. </p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">list1 + list2\n# output:&nbsp;[4, 5, 2, 7, 2, 1, 3, 3]</pre><p>Multiplying the two vectors together also results in an element by element operation:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">v1 * v2</pre><p>Gives us <code>array([ 8, 5, 6, 21])</code> since 4x2=8, 5x1=5 and so on.

All you need to do is use the PIL&nbsp;library to open the image and then create the ndarray using the image. You should see that your ndarray has 3 dimensions. The shape will be the resolution of your image. </p><figure><img height=\"226\" src=\"./5. 2020-10-13_10-31-07-65d5d16e9295629db82713dc42220031.png\" width=\"595\"></figure><p>Now feel free to manipulate your own images as you see fit.

Also, the industry has grown massively, producing many more films than before. The number of data points is so dense from 2000 onwards that they are overlapping. </p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-10-15_10-00-28-26cc75fe26fee70f2445c638aa490791.png\"></figure></body></html>"

Hmm... so this is clearly unrealistic. Why would our model tell us such nonsense?&nbsp;Well, the reason is that we are specifying what the model should be ahead of time - namely a straight line - and then finding the best straight line for our data. Considering that you can't have negative revenue or a negative budget, we have to be careful about interpreting our very simple model too literally. After all, it's just an estimate and this estimate will be the most accurate on the chart where we have the most data points (rather than at the extreme left or right). </p><p> What about the slope?&nbsp;The slope tells us that for every extra $1 in the budget, movie revenue increases by $3.1. So, that's pretty interesting. That means the higher our budget, the higher our estimated revenue. If budgets are all that matter to make lots of money, then studio executives and film financiers should try and produce the biggest films possible, right?&nbsp;Maybe that's exactly why we've seen a massive increase in budgets over the past 30 years. </p><figure><img src=\"./8. 2020-10-16_16-23-44-7a1c656b072897f661cc8efdfca94144.png\"></figure><p><strong>R-Squared:&nbsp;Goodness of Fit</strong></p><p>One measure of figuring out how well our model fits our data is by looking at a metric called r-squared.

The real world is <em>super complex</em>, so in many academic circles, if a researcher can build a simple model that explains over 50% or so of what is actually happening, then it's a pretty decent model. </p><p>Remember how we were quite sceptical about our regression looking at the chart for our <code>old_films</code>?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Challenge</h4><p>Run a linear regression for the <code>old_films</code>.

This is the most difficult aspect to teach in a tutorial because it's completely open-ended and requires some creativity. Often times you will be asking questions of the data, that it actually cannot answer - and that's ok. That's all part of the process of discovery. </p><p>Pause here for a moment and think about the kind of data you saw in the columns. Write down at least 3 questions that you'd like to explore as part of this analysis. For example, your question might go like: \"What percentage of the Nobel laureates were women?\" or \"How many prizes were given out in each category\". <strong>Practice coming up with a few of your own questions</strong>. </p><p>In the upcoming lessons, you might find that we will write the code to answer some of your questions. And if not, your questions make for a great exercise to take this analysis even further.</p><p><br></p><p>The challenges below are all based on questions we're going to ask the data:</p><p><br></p><h4>Challenge 2</h4><p>Create a <a href=\"https://plotly.com/python/pie-charts/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">donut chart using plotly</a> which shows how many prizes went to men compared to how many prizes went to women.

We see that out of all the Nobel laureates since 1901, only about 6.2% were women.</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">biology = df_data.sex.value_counts()\nfig = px.pie(labels=biology.index, \n             values=biology.values,\n             title=\"Percentage of Male vs. Female Winners\",\n             names=biology.index,\n             hole=0.4,)\n\nfig.update_traces(textposition='inside', textfont_size=15, textinfo='percent')\n\nfig.show()</pre><figure><img src=\"./3. 2020-10-20_11-56-24-23e01a3883d76f0a36dd62e0ad401479.png\"></figure><p><strong>Solution 3:&nbsp;The first 3 women to win</strong></p><p>Even without looking at the data, you might have already guessed one of the famous names:&nbsp;Marie Curie. </p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">df_data[df_data.sex == 'Female'].sort_values('year', ascending=True)[:3]</pre><p> <strong> </strong></p><figure><img src=\"./3. 2020-10-20_11-59-16-2880c50d998356973cfa975e30bd642c.png\"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution 4:&nbsp;The Repeat Winners</strong></p><p>Winning a Nobel prize is quite an achievement. However, some folks have actually won the prize multiple times. To find them, we can use many different approaches. One approach is to look for duplicates in the full_name column:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">is_winner = df_data.duplicated(subset=['full_name'], keep=False)\nmultiple_winners = df_data[is_winner]\nprint(f'There are {multiple_winners.full_name.nunique()}' \\\n      ' winners who were awarded the prize more than once.')</pre><p>There are 6 winners who were awarded the prize more than once.</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">col_subset = ['year', 'category', 'laureate_type', 'full_name']\nmultiple_winners[col_subset]</pre><p>Only 4 of the repeat laureates were individuals.</p><figure><img src=\"./3. 2020-10-20_12-04-43-b5e52b86991f0ee6b5fd0c49ee6e0d3d.png\"></figure><p>We see that Marie Curie actually got the Nobel prize twice - once in physics and once in chemistry. Linus Carl Pauling got it first in chemistry and later for peace given his work in promoting nuclear disarmament. Also, the International Red Cross was awarded the Peace prize a total of 3 times. The first two times were both during the devastating World Wars. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution 5: Number of Prizes per Category</strong></p><p>To find the number of unique categories in a column we can use:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">df_data.category.nunique()</pre><p>To generate the vertical plotly bar chart, we again use <code>.value_counts()</code>:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">prizes_per_category = df_data.category.value_counts()\nv_bar = px.bar(\n        x = prizes_per_category.index,\n        y = prizes_per_category.values,\n        color = prizes_per_category.values,\n        color_continuous_scale='Aggrnyl',\n        title='Number of Prizes Awarded per Category')\n\nv_bar.update_layout(xaxis_title='Nobel Prize Category', \n                    coloraxis_showscale=False,\n                    yaxis_title='Number of Prizes')\nv_bar.show()</pre><figure><img src=\"./3. 2020-10-20_13-59-47-6fea83b45bae6cda8e421d02b71aa380.png\"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution 6:&nbsp;The Economics Prize</strong></p><p>The chart above begs the question:&nbsp;\"Why are there so few prizes in the field of economics?\". Looking at the first couple of winners in the economics category, we have our answer:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">df_data[df_data.category == 'Economics'].sort_values('year')[:3]</pre><p>The economics prize is much newer. It was first awarded in 1969, compared to 1901 for physics. </p><figure><img src=\"./3. 2020-10-20_14-03-25-9b4e50252c31bbc38d8171905a26b9a5.png\"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution 7: Male and Female Winners by Category</strong></p><p>We already saw that overall, only 6.2% of Nobel prize winners were female. Does this vary by category?</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">cat_men_women = df_data.groupby(['category', 'sex'], \n                               as_index=False).agg({'prize': pd.Series.count})\ncat_men_women.sort_values('prize', ascending=False, inplace=True)</pre><p>We can combine <code>.groupby()</code> and <code>.agg()</code> with the <code>.count()</code> function. This way we can count the number of men and women by prize category. </p><figure><img height=\"462\" src=\"./3. 2020-10-20_14-06-59-34c0d756c22989eb982fcf00dd78bcff.png\" width=\"274\"></figure><p>We can then use <code>.color</code> the parameter in the <code>.bar()</code> function to mark the number of men and women on the chart:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">v_bar_split = px.bar(x = cat_men_women.category,\n                     y = cat_men_women.prize,\n                     color = cat_men_women.sex,\n                     title='Number of Prizes Awarded per Category split by Men and Women')\n\nv_bar_split.update_layout(xaxis_title='Nobel Prize Category', \n                          yaxis_title='Number of Prizes')\nv_bar_split.show()</pre><figure><img src=\"./3. 2020-10-20_14-09-23-ba9b59621175ffd123d135b4cd46fed5.png\"></figure><p>We see that overall the imbalance is pretty large with physics, economics, and chemistry.

These include the Soviet Union or Czechoslovakia for example. Hence, using <code>birth_country_current</code> is better, since it has the country name which controls the city where the laureate was born. Now, notice that this does not determine the laureates' nationality since some globetrotting folks gave birth to their future Nobel laureate children while abroad. Also, people's nationalities can change as they emigrate and acquire different citizenship or get married and change citizenship.

That way we get the total number of prizes in a single column too. This is important since we want to control the order for our bar chart. </p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">merged_df = pd.merge(cat_country, top20_countries, on='birth_country_current')\n# change column names\nmerged_df.columns = ['birth_country_current', 'category', 'cat_prize', 'total_prize'] \nmerged_df.sort_values(by='total_prize', inplace=True)</pre><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-10-20_15-42-03-e31d94a8366dcf1b7c91618eb9e234f9.png\"></figure><p>Now we can create our bar chart again.

Also, the US has more prizes in physics or medicine alone than all of France's prizes combined.

Nonetheless, this goes to show it is never too late to win a Nobel prize. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution 3:&nbsp;Descriptive Statistics and Histogram</strong></p><p>Using <code>.describe()</code> is a fantastic way to get a feeling for how the numbers are distributed in a particular column. However, actually visualising them on a histogram to see their distribution is highly recommended too since it allows us to see if we have a bell-shaped curve or something else. </p><figure><img height=\"287\" src=\"./7. 2020-10-20_17-08-21-9a93fed328b9fcb987fe7f1fe891213a.png\" width=\"417\"></figure><p>Here's what the histogram looks like:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4), dpi=200)\nsns.histplot(data=df_data,\n             x=df_data.winning_age,\n             bins=30)\nplt.xlabel('Age')\nplt.title('Distribution of Age on Receipt of Prize')\nplt.show()</pre><figure><img src=\"./7. 2020-10-20_17-10-14-da5c8f344ae6c5029801d057b8fdc7da.png\"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution 4:&nbsp;Winning Age Over Time (All Categories)</strong></p><p>The histogram above shows us the distribution across the entire dataset, over the entire time period.

This means the best fit line is still linear, but it's more like a moving average which gives us a non-linear shape across the entire series. This is super neat because it clearly shows how the Nobel laureates are getting their award later and later in life. From 1900 to around 1950, the laureates were around 55 years old, but these days they are closer to 70 years old when they get their award!&nbsp;The other thing that we see in the chart is that in the last 10 years the spread has increased. We've had more very young and very old winners. In 1950s/60s winners were between 30 and 80 years old. Lately, that range has widened. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution 5:&nbsp;Age Differences between Categories</strong></p><p>Seaborn allows us to create the above chart by category. But first, let's look at a box plot by category. </p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">plt.figure(figsize=(8,4), dpi=200)\nwith sns.axes_style(\"whitegrid\"):\n    sns.boxplot(data=df_data,\n                x='category',\n                y='winning_age')\n\nplt.show()</pre><p>The box plot shows us the mean, the quartiles, the maximum and the minimum values.

The box plot above looked at the dataset as a whole. </p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">with sns.axes_style('whitegrid'):\n    sns.lmplot(data=df_data,\n               x='year', \n               y='winning_age',\n               row = 'category',\n               lowess=True, \n               aspect=2,\n               scatter_kws = {'alpha': 0.6},\n               line_kws = {'color': 'black'},)\n\nplt.show()</pre><p>We see that winners in physics, chemistry, and medicine have gotten older over time. The ageing trend is strongest for physics. The average age used to be below 50, but now it's over 70. Economics, the newest category, is much more stable in comparison. The peace prize shows the opposite trend where winners are getting younger! As such, our scatter plots showing the best fit lines over time and our box plot of the entire dataset can tell very different stories!</p><figure><img src=\"./7. 2020-10-20_17-31-22-d66b1a164a613c588b625f824fd37dfa.gif\"></figure><p>To combine all these charts into the same chart, we can use the <code>hue</code> parameter</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">with sns.axes_style(\"whitegrid\"):\n    sns.lmplot(data=df_data,\n               x='year',\n               y='winning_age',\n               hue='category',\n               lowess=True, \n               aspect=2,\n               scatter_kws={'alpha': 0.5},\n               line_kws={'linewidth': 5})\n\nplt.show()</pre><figure><img src=\"./7. 2020-10-20_17-32-54-bd27d07d133eb4afa6b96be9fe335ed3.png\"></figure><p><br></p><figure><img src=\"./7. 2020-11-20_12-49-10-3cca1f54799d09e076819c184a0c184a.png\"></figure><p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/prize\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smbc-comics.com</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></body></html>"

So, Dr. Semmelweis, had women in the doctors' clinic give birth on their sides.

Perhaps the priest and the bell ringing terrified the women so much after birth that they developed a fever, got sick and died. Dr Semmelweis had the priest change his route and stop ringing the bell \ud83d\udd15. Again, this had no effect. </p><p>At this point, Dr Semmelweis was so frustrated he went on holiday to Venice. Perhaps a short break would clear his head. When Semmelweis returned from his vacation, he was told that one of his colleagues, a pathologist, had fallen ill and died. His friend had pricked his finger while doing an autopsy on a woman who had died from childbed fever and subsequently got very sick himself and died. \ud83d\ude2e</p><p>Looking at the pathologist's symptoms, Semmelweis realised the pathologist died from the same thing as the women he had autopsied.&nbsp; This was his breakthrough: anyone could get sick from childbed fever, not just women giving birth! </p><p>This is what led to Semmelweis' new theory. Perhaps there were little pieces or particles of a corpse that the doctors and medical students were getting on their hands while dissecting the cadavers during an autopsy. And when the doctors delivered the babies in clinic 1, these particles would get inside the women giving birth who would then develop the disease and die.</p></body></html>"

Let's take a look at a histogram to get a better sense of the distribution.</p><p><br></p><h4>Challenge 3: Use Histograms to Visualise the Monthly Distribution of Outcomes</h4><p>Create a <a href=\"https://plotly.com/python/histograms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plotly histogram</a> to show the monthly percentage of deaths.</p><ul><li><p>Use docs to check out the available parameters.

This creates two separate histograms for us. When we set the opacity to 0.6 or so we can clearly see how the histograms overlap. The trick to getting a sensible-looking histogram when you have a very different number of observations is to set the <code>histnorm</code> to 'percent'. That way the histogram with more observations won't completely overshadow the shorter series.</p><pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\">hist = px.histogram(df_monthly, \n                   x='pct_deaths', \n                   color='washing_hands',\n                   nbins=30,\n                   opacity=0.6,\n                   barmode='overlay',\n                   histnorm='percent',\n                   marginal='box',)\n\nhist.update_layout(xaxis_title='Proportion of Monthly Deaths',\n                   yaxis_title='Count',)\n\nhist.show()</pre><p>I&nbsp;quite like how in plotly we can display our box plot from earlier at the top. </p><figure><img src=\"./5. 2020-10-23_14-49-58-3961b13cff88b2866bba7da183716a04.png\"></figure><p>Now, we have only about 98 data points or so, so our histogram looks a bit jagged. It's not a smooth bell-shaped curve.

Despite the incredible evidence in favour of Dr Semmelweis' theory - that childbed fever was caused by some \"substance\" (which today we know as bacteria) from autopsy room corpses - was rejected by the medical community at the time. But why?!&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the reason is that Semmelweis was not very tactful. He made it look like doctors were <em>giving</em> childbed fever to women (which they in fact were). This is not something people wanted to hear. </p><p>However, he also published his data in the form of long tables <strong>without</strong> any data visualisations:</p><figure><img src=\"./6. 2020-10-23_15-25-37-28877dab514343720243ddca867f7da4.png\"></figure><p>The long tables made it very hard to see what's actually going on! Also, at the time statistics and statistical arguments were quite uncommon in the field of medicine. </p><p>Eventually, Dr Semmelweis belligerent campaigning made him some powerful and influential enemies. He lost his job at the Vienna hospital, and doctors gave up washing their hands with chlorine. As Dr Semmelweis grew older he got even angrier and eventually quite \"strange\". This was either the immense frustration or possibly a result of another disease like Alzheimer's or syphilis. In 1965, at the age of 47, Dr Semmelweis was committed to a mental asylum. And at the asylum, he was probably beaten since he eventually died of sepsis, a complication of an infection in the bloodstream. The tragic irony is that sepsis is a similar kind of disease that he fought so hard to prevent in women who died from childbed fever. It wasn't until 20 years later with Louis Pasteur's work on germ theory that Dr Semmelweis' work gained acceptance. RIP Dr Semmelweis. </p><p>Here's how you can wash your hands like a surgeon:</p><figure><img src=\"./6. 2020-10-23_15-21-50-a2cee16c7b72811c007ed921900d481f.gif\"></figure><p>You can download the completed code for today in this lesson.</p></body></html>"
