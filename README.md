## 📚 Project Overview

### What is this project?

This application is a personal learning companion. It loads a full curriculum (e.g. 32-week roadmap for learning Python, data, ML, trading, design patterns, etc.), and provides a user interface to:

- View weekly / daily tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Track progress (XP, levels, streaks, completion %)  
- Journal weekly reflections / check-ins  
- See overall statistics and achievements (badges, levels)  
- Visualize progress over time (charts, streaks)  

### Why build it?

Because learning complex, multi-phase skills (Python → Data → Trading → ML/RL → Software architecture) requires structure, consistency, and motivation. This app transforms a long roadmap into manageable daily/weekly tasks, adds accountability, and gamifies progress — turning learning into a rewarding, habit-forming journey.  

### Who is it for?

Initially for a single user (you), but architecture should support scaling to multiple users in the future (e.g. for a small team, study group, or public release).

## ✅ Key Features

- ✅ Full roadmap loaded (weeks, tasks, milestones, check-in prompts)  
- ✅ Dashboard showing current week, today’s tasks, weekly progress  
- ✅ Planner view: full roadmap with expandable weeks and daily tasks statuses  
- ✅ Task completion — mark tasks done, gain XP / points  
- ✅ Weekly reflections / journal — prompts and saveable entries  
- ✅ Progress & Stats page — total tasks done, completion %, XP, level, streak, badge list  
- ✅ Gamification: XP, levels, badges, progress bars, celebratory feedback (on task / milestone completion)  
- ✅ Achievements/Badges system — e.g. complete a week, hit a 4-week streak, finish major modules  
- ✅ Data persistence — store tasks status, reflections, achievements  
- ✅ REST API backend (e.g. via FastAPI) + database  
- ✅ Frontend (web UI) — responsive, intuitive, friendly  
- ✅ Modular architecture — backend / frontend separation, clear data model, easy to extend

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Framework:** FastAPI 0.104.1
- **Server:** Uvicorn 0.24.0
- **Database:** SQLite
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy 2.0.23
- **Data Validation:** Pydantic 2.5.2

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React 18.2.0
- **Build Tool:** Vite 5.0.0
- **Routing:** React Router 6.20.0
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3.3.5
- **Testing:** Playwright 1.57.0 (E2E)

### Pyodide / SharedArrayBuffer (Cross-Origin Isolation)

Pyodide may require `SharedArrayBuffer`, which is only available when the page is **cross-origin isolated**.

- **Local dev/preview**
  - Vite is configured to send these headers (see `frontend/vite.config.js`):
    - `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
    - `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`
  - You can verify in the browser console with `window.crossOriginIsolated === true`.
  - There is an E2E guard test in `frontend/tests/e2e/cross-origin-isolation.spec.ts`.

- **Production (Vercel)**
  - The same headers are configured in `vercel.json` under `headers`.
  - Live URL: https://learning-tracker-nu-tan.vercel.app

### Deployment & DevOps
- **Containerization:** Docker (optional)
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Package Managers:** pip (Python), npm (Node.js)

| `Week` | Represents a week in the roadmap; contains tasks, milestone, check-in prompt |
| `Task` | A daily or periodic task: day, description, XP reward, badge possibility |
| `UserTaskStatus` | Links user ↔ task: tracks completion status and timestamp |
