Well done. You've just completed your first day.

1
00:04.960 --> 00:09.960
And remember that a journey of a thousand miles can't begin without the first

2
00:10.390 --> 00:14.620
step. So congratulations on doing that and completing it.

3
00:15.400 --> 00:15.700
Now,

4
00:15.700 --> 00:20.110
remember that the first few days might take a little bit longer than an hour to

5
00:20.110 --> 00:20.920
complete,

6
00:20.920 --> 00:25.480
just because I've got so much to teach you and so much to cram into each of

7
00:25.480 --> 00:29.380
these days. So it doesn't matter if you need to take a break in between,

8
00:29.650 --> 00:33.880
or if you need to take a nap in between even. Just come back to it whenever you

9
00:33.880 --> 00:38.710
can, and you don't have to do it strictly in the day by day order. Now,

10
00:38.710 --> 00:43.710
my hope is that you'll keep going and you'll come back tomorrow refreshed and

11
00:43.760 --> 00:47.930
you'll tackle the next day subjects with the same vigor that you did today.

12
00:48.440 --> 00:51.710
So, have a good rest and I'll see you tomorrow.
