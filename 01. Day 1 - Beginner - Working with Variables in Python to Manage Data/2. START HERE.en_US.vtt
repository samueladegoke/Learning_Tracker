Hi, this is where you start the course.

1
00:05.280 --> 00:10.280
But first I want to tell you a little bit about it, because this is more than a

2
00:10.740 --> 00:14.640
course. It's a journey. And it's a challenge.

3
00:15.510 --> 00:19.260
A challenge to yourself. I often hear people say,

4
00:19.440 --> 00:23.430
"I want to learn to code". "I want to become an app developer". "I want a new job".

5
00:23.700 --> 00:26.940
"I want to build my app", but without action,

6
00:27.210 --> 00:31.410
those words are meaningless. But *you* are different!

7
00:31.920 --> 00:35.160
I know it. Even though I don't know you personally,

8
00:35.550 --> 00:38.910
I know you purchased this course and you haven't left it at that.

9
00:39.570 --> 00:44.570
You've made a start. And success comes to those who show up. And you showed up

10
00:44.850 --> 00:49.740
today. I know you can do this. You can make your dreams come true.

11
00:49.980 --> 00:53.700
You can change your own future and you can change the lives of those people

12
00:53.700 --> 00:54.533
around you.

13
00:55.260 --> 00:59.970
One of the questions I hear most often is: "What's the best way to learn to code?".

14
01:00.720 --> 01:01.500
Well, here it

15
01:01.500 --> 01:06.500
is! It's the 100 days of code challenge. Code for at least an hour. ⏳

16
01:06.720 --> 01:11.520
Over 100 days. You're practising a muscle to get strong at coding.

17
01:12.600 --> 01:16.410
Then the next question inevitably is: "Well,

18
01:16.560 --> 01:21.420
what do I do each day?" And I've spent years thinking about this question.

19
01:22.080 --> 01:22.913
And finally,

20
01:23.280 --> 01:27.780
I'm now able to definitively answer that ... it's this course!

21
01:29.760 --> 01:33.900
Every day, you're going to learn and apply new programming concepts.

22
01:34.740 --> 01:37.200
After a hundred days of repeating this process,

23
01:37.560 --> 01:42.000
not only will you have covered the entire professional Python curriculum,

24
01:42.390 --> 01:45.540
you'll also be so good that they can't ignore you.

25
01:46.710 --> 01:49.860
There are just two rules to get the most out of this course.

26
01:50.550 --> 01:55.550
1) Pledge to code for an hour a day for a 100 days. To keep yourself

27
01:56.610 --> 01:59.400
accountable. I recommend downloading the course pledge.

28
01:59.790 --> 02:04.350
This is a contract 🤝 with yourself. You can print it out and pin 📌 it somewhere.

29
02:04.350 --> 02:08.640
You can always see, for example, above your computer or on your desk.

30
02:09.480 --> 02:13.050
By signing the pledge, you're making a commitment to yourself.

31
02:13.470 --> 02:16.380
It's only for you. No one else needs to see it.

32
02:17.520 --> 02:20.970
You can download the pledge in the course resources for this lesson.

33
02:22.080 --> 02:24.870
The second rule is to log your progress.

34
02:25.080 --> 02:28.470
Using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag on Twitter.

35
02:29.400 --> 02:32.310
There are millions of other students who are on this journey with you.

36
02:32.760 --> 02:35.130
And they will support you when times get tough.

37
02:35.880 --> 02:40.350
I recommend tweeting your progress each day with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode

38
02:40.350 --> 02:45.350
and search the hashtag on Twitter to see what others are doing as a part

39
02:45.360 --> 02:48.840
of their 100 days. And that's all there is to it!

40
02:49.290 --> 02:53.640
So here's to your success and let's get started with the course. 🤞
