<html><head></head><body><p>In the coming lessons, we'll be using the PyCharm Integrated Development Environment to learn to code. It's a completely free piece of software and is used by professional Python developers across the globe. They also have a handy course template feature, which we'll be using for the beginner parts of the lessons from Day 1 to 15. So while you might have another favourite code editor, I only recommend to use PyCharm for this course. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p><p>Download and install Python to your computer. Head over to the official Python website to download the latest version of Python for your computer system. Then complete the installation.</p><p>Make sure you tick the box to <strong>Add to PATH</strong> / <strong>Add to Environment Variables</strong>. You will also need <strong>tcl/tk</strong> later in the course, so a Custom install gives you access to all of these settings.</p><p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p><p>Download the Free Community Edition of PyCharm using the link below:</p><p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/edu-products/download/#section=pycharm-edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.jetbrains.com/edu-products/download/#section=pycharm-edu</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>IMPORTANT: If you already have PyCharm, make sure you update to the latest version of PyCharm otherwise the steps below might not work!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p><p>Once PyCharm installs successfully, you should see the welcome screen.
