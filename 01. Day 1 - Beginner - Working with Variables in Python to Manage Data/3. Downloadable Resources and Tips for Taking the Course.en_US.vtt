Hey guys, it's Angela here. After I made this course,

1
00:05.640 --> 00:10.640
I decided to take it myself so I could see what it's like to be in your shoes.

2
00:11.760 --> 00:15.420
Along the way, I realized there are things we could create,

3
00:15.750 --> 00:20.190
to make your learning experience easier and even more enjoyable.

4
00:20.970 --> 00:23.850
So in this video, I'm going to share my top tips.

5
00:24.270 --> 00:28.140
And how do you use all the tools 🛠 and resources we built for you.

6
00:29.910 --> 00:33.570
The first tip I have for you is to use another screen.

7
00:34.290 --> 00:39.290
That way you can watch the lesson on a tablet or phone and code on your main

8
00:39.690 --> 00:44.130
computer. So you can code along with me and get practice

9
00:44.340 --> 00:48.960
instead of just listening to the videos. Programming is a practical skill.

10
00:49.080 --> 00:53.070
So, just as you need practice, when learning skateboarding 🛹,

11
00:53.640 --> 00:58.640
you also need practice to get good at Programming. Tip number two:

12
00:59.220 --> 01:04.080
I created a Python syntax cheat sheet, which you can download and print out.

13
01:04.740 --> 01:08.640
It contains some of the most common programming concepts we'll learn.

14
01:09.030 --> 01:13.140
And it's a handy reference to have when you're doing the coding challenges.

15
01:13.710 --> 01:18.540
You can download this in the course resources for this lesson where you will

16
01:18.540 --> 01:22.170
also find my "12 Rules to Learn to Code" eBook.

17
01:23.070 --> 01:27.360
One of the hardest things about learning is keeping the ✨motivation✨ high.

18
01:28.170 --> 01:33.170
I find I'm usually more motivated when I'm in the library or a cafe where I can

19
01:33.420 --> 01:36.060
see other people studying or working hard.

20
01:36.840 --> 01:41.840
So I decided to create a two-hour "Study with Me" a video where I'm concentrating

21
01:42.390 --> 01:45.810
hard. We'll work for 25 minutes at a time,

22
01:46.200 --> 01:51.200
and then take a five-minute break before we get back to the next Pomodoro 🍅. Tip

23
01:51.570 --> 01:55.800
number four: when you're learning new programming concepts

24
01:56.040 --> 02:01.040
it's a good idea to note down how the code works while your mind is fresh on

25
02:01.050 --> 02:01.883
that topic.

26
02:02.430 --> 02:07.430
So I created a coding notes page that you can print out and collate to create a

27
02:08.430 --> 02:09.660
coding notebook.

28
02:10.530 --> 02:15.530
The notepaper is the perfect place to write down examples of coding concepts

29
02:16.500 --> 02:17.333
you've learnt.

30
02:17.850 --> 02:21.900
It comes with line numbers and handy indentation guides,

31
02:22.320 --> 02:27.320
which is super useful when it comes to writing out Python code. Coding is not

32
02:28.530 --> 02:32.190
like history. There's nothing you need to memorize.

33
02:32.730 --> 02:36.420
It's a bit like baking. You don't need to remember the recipe.

34
02:36.750 --> 02:41.160
You just need to get practice and understand how to use the recipe.

35
02:41.820 --> 02:46.820
One of the most helpful note-taking systems for learning is the Cornell note

36
02:47.220 --> 02:50.070
method. In our coding notebook

37
02:50.130 --> 02:53.880
we've incorporated all the key elements from Cornell,

38
02:54.540 --> 02:59.540
including the sidebar where you can write comments on each line of code and the

39
03:00.310 --> 03:01.930
bottom summary section,

40
03:02.290 --> 03:07.290
where you can write an overview of the concept you just learnt. In the course

41
03:07.390 --> 03:09.010
resources for this lesson

42
03:09.370 --> 03:14.370
you'll also find some desktop wallpapers I've created for you that contain

43
03:15.060 --> 03:19.350
some of the messages I keep around my desk to keep me motivated,

44
03:19.770 --> 03:24.270
and I hope they'll help you too. Tip number five:

45
03:24.990 --> 03:27.600
celebrate right after you complete each day.

46
03:28.380 --> 03:32.730
Because this course is designed to take you from beginner to professional,

47
03:33.210 --> 03:34.860
as you go from day to day,

48
03:34.920 --> 03:39.920
there will be less and less tutorial and more and more practice. To keep you on

49
03:40.290 --> 03:44.040
track, I've created a "100 Days of Code" poster.

50
03:44.940 --> 03:49.410
Once you complete a day, you can check it off on the poster. So print it out,

51
03:49.590 --> 03:53.190
put it up on a wall and take each day as a challenge.

52
03:53.790 --> 03:58.290
Reward yourself after each day you tick off ✅ and day by day,

53
03:58.320 --> 04:00.480
you will learn and grow as a developer.

54
04:01.620 --> 04:06.300
This course has a safe space where you can make mistakes, ask questions,

55
04:06.780 --> 04:11.760
but most importantly become confident in your skills as a programmer.

56
04:13.050 --> 04:15.510
I had so much fun building this course,

57
04:15.990 --> 04:19.140
and I hope that you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

58
04:19.830 --> 04:22.020
So here's to your success!
