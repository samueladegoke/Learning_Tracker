Hello and welcome to the world's best Python bootcamp!

1
00:07.320 --> 00:08.490
My name is Angela 👩🏻‍🏫

2
00:08.610 --> 00:12.150
I'm a Senior Developer and the lead instructor at the App Brewery,

3
00:12.630 --> 00:16.230
London's highest-rated programming bootcamp. To date,

4
00:16.440 --> 00:20.400
I've taught over a half a million students in-person and online,

5
00:20.940 --> 00:24.840
and I'm so excited to be your instructor on this course.

6
00:25.170 --> 00:26.520
As a student on this course,

7
00:26.580 --> 00:31.350
you're going to get access to over 56 hours of HD video content,

8
00:31.740 --> 00:36.090
which contains step-by-step tutorials, interactive, coding exercises,

9
00:36.210 --> 00:37.620
quizzes, and more.

10
00:38.220 --> 00:41.700
The course is structured around the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

11
00:42.180 --> 00:47.180
So you can look forward to a 100 days of lovingly crafted content that is

12
00:47.490 --> 00:52.490
going to cover every aspect of Python programming from Web Development to Data

13
00:52.980 --> 00:53.813
Science.

14
00:53.940 --> 00:58.940
It's the only course you need to become a professional Python developer. Every day

15
00:59.850 --> 01:03.780
on the course, you are going to use what you've learned to build a new project.

16
01:04.440 --> 01:07.950
You'll build a bot 🤖 that texts you in the morning. If it will rain ☔️ that day.

17
01:08.280 --> 01:10.260
So you never forget your umbrella again.

18
01:10.650 --> 01:15.650
You'll build classic arcade games 👾 like Snake and Pong to impress your friends 😮

19
01:15.930 --> 01:18.600
by challenging them to a game that *you* built.

20
01:19.440 --> 01:23.880
You'll learn to make sense of complex data and create beautiful visualizations

21
01:24.090 --> 01:25.980
to impress your colleagues at work. 

22
01:26.850 --> 01:31.110
You'll create a program that automatically sends "Happy Birthday" emails to your

23
01:31.110 --> 01:34.320
friends and family. Never forget mom's birthday 🎂 again!

24
01:34.740 --> 01:39.690
You'll work on projects that clone real-world startups. Cheap flight club: check ✅.

25
01:39.900 --> 01:42.990

01:47.640 --> 01:49.860
100 projects in total.

28
01:50.640 --> 01:54.180
So if you are somebody who wants to get a job as a Python developer,

29
01:54.270 --> 01:58.590
then this is perfect for building up your portfolio to show off at your next

30
01:58.590 --> 01:59.423
interview.

31
01:59.910 --> 02:04.910
Now, this course assumes absolutely no prior programming experience.

32
02:05.460 --> 02:07.980
So if you are somebody who's never coded before,

33
02:08.370 --> 02:12.930
I'll be with you every step of the way as I take you from programming

34
02:12.930 --> 02:17.400
fundamentals through to more intermediate and advanced programming concepts.

35
02:17.970 --> 02:20.820
You're going to learn Python from scratch. Now,

36
02:20.850 --> 02:24.330
if you are an advanced developer 👨‍💻 on the other hand then take a look at the

37
02:24.330 --> 02:29.100
curriculum and start at the level that suits you best. From beginner to

38
02:29.100 --> 02:33.630
professional, every level is covered in the course. Got school?

39
02:33.660 --> 02:37.980
Working a full-time job? Have to look after kids? I know you're busy.

40
02:38.490 --> 02:40.260
I've ⏳ timed each day of the course,

41
02:40.290 --> 02:42.690
to take less than 2 hours to complete.

42
02:43.020 --> 02:45.330
So you can fit the course around your life.

43
02:45.720 --> 02:50.580
This course has exactly the same curriculum as our in-person programming

44
02:50.580 --> 02:54.930
bootcamp. So instead of spending thousands of dollars and taking time off work,

45
02:55.290 --> 02:56.400
you will get access to

46
02:56.400 --> 03:01.400
exactly the same curriculum with years of design and testing behind it to insure

47
03:01.510 --> 03:05.710
that you don't just know what to do, but also why you're doing it. Now,

48
03:05.740 --> 03:07.300
don't just take my word for it.

49
03:07.660 --> 03:10.360
Check out what my past students had to say about my courses.
