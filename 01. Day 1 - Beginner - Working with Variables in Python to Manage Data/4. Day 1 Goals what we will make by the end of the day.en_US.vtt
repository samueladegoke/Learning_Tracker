Hey guys, welcome to Day 1 of your 100-Day journey.

1
00:05.450 --> 00:12.170
And today we're going to learn about Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String manipulation and Variables.

2
00:12.170 --> 00:15.860
So it's chock-a-block full of really fun stuff.

3
00:15.860 --> 00:22.460
And by the end of today, you will have created a Band Name Generator program.

4
00:22.760 --> 00:25.970
So this is the final project of today.

5
00:25.970 --> 00:31.900
And the idea is that let's say that your friend was starting a new band, a rock band or a classical

6
00:31.900 --> 00:36.040
band, and they're struggling to come up with a good name.

7
00:36.040 --> 00:40.720
So you come into the rescue and send them your Band Name Generator program.

8
00:40.720 --> 00:43.570
So it asks you for the name of the city that you grew up in,

9
00:43.570 --> 00:48.100
so mine was Bristol in the southwest of the UK.

10
00:48.250 --> 00:51.550
And then it'll ask you, what's the name of your pet?

11
00:52.000 --> 00:58.870
I had a pet rabbit when I was younger, and I am probably, the least imaginative person, 

12
00:58.870 --> 01:01.240
classic programmer personality,

13
01:01.240 --> 01:03.790
so I called my rabbit, "Rabbit".

14
01:04.510 --> 01:12.160
So now when I hit Enter, it's going to give me my band name, and it could be, Bristol Rabbit.

15
01:12.820 --> 01:14.230
So that sounds pretty cool.

16
01:14.230 --> 01:16.180
It could be like a rock band.

17
01:16.330 --> 01:17.730
So this is what you're going to make,

18
01:17.730 --> 01:23.640
and in the process, in order to create this, you're going to learn about Printing, Inputting, Commenting,

19
01:23.640 --> 01:29.580
Debugging, Name Errors, Syntax Errors, String Manipulation Variables, and a whole lot more.

20
01:29.580 --> 01:35.640
So if you feel like you can already achieve this, and you can prove it by making this program yourself,

21
01:35.640 --> 01:39.060
then feel free to skip to the next day's lessons.

22
01:39.060 --> 01:43.890
But for most of you, even if you've started learning Python programming, there's probably still a

23
01:43.890 --> 01:47.040
lot of new things that you'll find in today's lessons.

24
01:47.460 --> 01:53.370
Now, as with all the projects that we're making in this course, you get to try it out before you make

25
01:53.370 --> 01:53.550
it.

26
01:53.550 --> 01:56.670
So you can either go to the URL,

27
01:57.030 --> 02:02.670
alternatively, if you don't want to type out the full URL, you can head over to the Course content

28
02:02.670 --> 02:08.450
here, and then click on the Resources and click this link to head straight over there.

29
02:08.450 --> 02:14.510
And then once you're there, all you have to do is to click Run and you'll be able to preview how the

30
02:14.510 --> 02:16.550
final product is going to work.

31
02:16.550 --> 02:22.640
So you can type in your own city and follow the instructions until you get to the end result.

32
02:22.640 --> 02:28.970
So once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and let's get started and get coding straight away.
